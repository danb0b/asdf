## Engineering Failure

* Fatigue
* Cracking
* Stress

## Keywords

* "culture of safety"
* "factor of safety"
* "FMEA"
* "risk assessment"
* "threat assessment"


## Ways to Mitigate Failure

### Documentation

* Signs, Warnings, Labels
* Labels
* Safety Manuals
* MSDS
* Tagout
* Nutrition Information, ie "warning, contains ingredients processed on lines that handle nuts", Phenalkenatics, etc
* Procedures: In case of emergency.

### Personnel

* Safety Inspections
* Training
* Communication Standards
    * On Belay / Belay On /Climbing
    * Alpha Bravo Charlie vs greek

### Studies

* Anticipatory Studies
    * Simulations, models, analysis, equations
* Post-Mortems
    * literally the coroner's office
    * exponent
    * FAA

### Technical

* Prevention
    * Child-proof containers
    * Redundancy
    * Passwords
    * Encryption & Permissions
    * Keys & Locks
    * E-stops
    * Lockout
* Sensing
* Testing
    * UL / CE
    * drop test
    * cycle test
    * how they test planes
    * How they test concrete

### Regulatory

* Codes & Standards
  * IEEE
  * ASME Codes
  * ...
* Licensing

## Assignments

1. identify leading (non-medical) causes of death at home/work.  
1. create an FMEA for an activity  in the home.  cooking? garage? yard work?
    * identify changes that could be made
1. create , implement, and test a safety feature at home / work
    * observe whether it works
    * observe whether it makes the product more usable
    * look for workarounds
    * test with a child
1. visit a working environment and document safety measures in place.
    * take pictures
1. interview manager in charge of safety
    * discuss leading causes of accidents on the job
1. Walk through someone else's kitchen
    * take photos
    * perform a risk assesment
1.  Identify a man-made accident or disaster which is the result of human error
    * find at least three(3) news articles
    * document impacts: loss of life, damage, quality of life, health, safety, security, etc?
    * document cause(s): there are often a mix of issues which lead to a disaster, including communication, safety culture, engineering mistakes, failure to anticipate conditions, stress, age, failure to test
    * identify technical causes
    * identify human causes
    * identify key factor which served as the trigger.  was it technical in nature or a human problem?
    * document timeline or sequence of events in a page
    * describe steps which would have 1) eliminated the risk
    * describe factors which exacerbated damage or loss of life
    * describe factors which could have reduced damage or loss of life
    * categorize each type of failure: technical, regulatory? personnel?  what kind(s)?

### Final Project

* identify a business
* reach out to and obtain contact infor for safety manager
* interview
* visit
* identify a candidate process for performing an FMEA
    * consider restaurants, manufacturing, day cares, 
    * must be unique
* perform an FMEA
* propose a solution
* perform an FMEA on solution
* implement solution
* return and document changes, improvements
* discuss

-   4 ounces reduced-fat cream cheese (Neufchatel)
-   3/4 cup low-fat vanilla yogurt

## Directions

1.  Using a fork, break up cream cheese in a medium bowl.
2.  Drain off any liquid from the yogurt, and add yogurt to the bowl along with honey.

4.  Stir in lemon zest.
5.  Layer the lemon cream and blueberries in dessert dishes or wineglasses.

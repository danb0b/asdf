## Ingredients

* 1 ½ cups heavy cream
* ½ cup granulated sugar
* 12 ounces dark chocolate, roughly chopped
* 4 large eggs, at room temperature
* ¼ cup strong (brewed) espresso (or very strongly brewed coffee)
* ¼ cup light or dark rum (or Marsala or brandy)
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* ½ teaspoon kosher salt

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, or in a stand mixer on medium speed, whip the heavy cream to glossy, medium peaks, about 5 minutes. Set aside in the fridge. In a small saucepan over gentle heat, melt the sugar with 1/4 cup water until dissolved. As soon as the syrup begins to boil, turn off the heat.
1. Add chocolate and eggs to a blender. Blend on medium-high speed while slowly pouring in the hot sugar syrup, which will melt the chocolate and cook the eggs. Keep the machine running until the mixture is extremely smooth, then stream in the espresso, rum, vanilla and salt. Keep blending until the mixture has cooled to room temperature, about 1 minute, pausing to scrape the sides as needed.
1. Fold 1 cup of the chocolate mixture into the chilled whipped cream until smooth, then add the rest of the chocolate mixture to the cream mixture and fold until there are no streaks. Pour into individual bowls, ramekins or glasses, and set in the fridge until firm, at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours. Serve chilled.

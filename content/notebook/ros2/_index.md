The purpose of this project is to teach lab members how to use ROS2 for a number of purposes specific to the activities of a robotics lab like the IDEAlab.

In contrast with its name, ROS2 is not an operating system.  It is a way to have vast, disparate sources of data come together in networked way in order to perform tasks important to robotics, such as simulation, sensing, control, learning, and teleoperation.  It coordinates the transfer of information from one place to another in a way that is scalable

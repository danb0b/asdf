Walking down about a hundred steps with my arms full of bags was not my favorite, but it was pretty special that we could hike with all of our luggage to the bus stop about a kilometer without needing any special help.</p><p>Our bus was more of a minibus this time, and it fit the road that we traveled on. It seems like Macedonia is overhauling their highway system pretty dramatically, but we were not fortunate enough to be on those roads yet. It was one of the twistiest and turniest roads, with the drivers going many different speeds necessitating our driver to pass a lot of people at high speed around tight corners going up a hill. We all looked a little green after that trip</p><p>Once at the bus station in SKOPJE, we quickly found a cab who took us to our next apartment, a third story loft above a coffee shop owned by the same person. It was very quaint, very cute and a little bit too warm when we entered. The town of skopje is surrounded by mountains and a little bit lower in elevation which made our time in the town a little bit more constrained by the weather. I went out to the store to get some fresh food and we had a pasta dinner and an early evening.</p><h2 id=tuesday-august-22-2023>Tuesday, August 22, 2023</h2><p>The next morning we headed out early so that we can see the city before it got too warm. It was due to get up to around 100°F, so we wanted to be back pretty early. We walked straight into the main square that has a gigantic sculpture of Alexander the Great. Walking around the square and along our path, we realized that SK OPJE is overrun with sculptures, all of them big, representing all sorts of events and people from macedonia&rsquo;s past. We learned only later the provenance and reasons for many of these sculptures</p><p>We made our way across the Old stone bridge and into the bazaar where we looked for evidence of magical artifacts and had breakfast.</p><p>After breakfast we headed home and did nearly a full day of school. Sarav set up shop in the little office area of the apartment and got some work done. I took Max downstairs to get a coffee, and treated him to a &ldquo;baby coffee&rdquo;.</p><p>That evening at 5:00 I met up with a tour group and did the free Scorpio walking tour. I learned a lot of interesting facts about the buildings, the history, the people, and the politics. Some of the most interesting things that I learned about were there regarding Scorpio 2014 and some of the controversies surrounding many of the art installations and unfinished renovations that had occurred in the city up until about 2018. Looking around it was pretty obvious after the tour to see how much of the city had changed, and why it have been so controversial ($).</p><h2 id=wednesday-august-23-2023>Wednesday, August 23, 2023</h2><p>The next morning we visited e matka canyon, a local tourist attraction that is about a 45 minute drive out of the city. We took a taxi there and were dropped off at the last bus stop. We hiked all the way to the end of the trail, about 4 km from the entrance, plus about two more from the bus stop. It was a unique hike because so few people have obviously done it. The trail gets smaller and smaller and by about the third kilometer in youre bushwhacking along I know a trail or beside a steep cliff with battered railings. I thought the trip would be worth it, just because of that, and was excited to show the kids how destination, a cave across the river.</p><p>Unfortunately, my map aired and forgot to let me know that our route had one small problem&mldr; There was no bridge across the river. Making it to the end of the trail, we saw people getting off the many water taxis and small tour boats varying them up the river on the other side, but after scrambling down, we saw that the only way across was to either swim or ask One of the boats. Luckily, as we got to the bottom of the canyon of boat operator asked us if we&rsquo;d like a ride which we accepted. He buried us across to a small platform where we spent about an hour snacking and jumping in the water. It was about 10° c, which really took the breath away. Sam jumped in seven times, I jumped in a couple times, but Mom was the first to take the plunge. She offered ice cream to anyone who jumped in.</p><p>After drying off a little bit I took the kids up to the cave entrance and we explored it for 10 minutes. It wasn&rsquo;t big but it was pretty interesting. The water level in the cave was quite high, and after descending back down into it after a short hike up it looked like it was probably about the same level as the river itself, which explains the cold temperatures we felt in the reservoir.</p><p>Coming down the steps from the cave entrance we saw that our boat operator had returned. He showed us to a second boat that we took back to the entrance to the canyon. We walked back to the bus stop, grabbing ice cream and roasted corn on the way, and found a taxi to take us back to our place for a thousand dinar.</p><p>Not wanting to cook that night he walked back to the bazaar and had a very traditional movie dinner of kebabs. We realized that the kabobs everyone was talking about was the same as the savapi we had in Croatia just slightly different spelling. We paired that with a Shopko salad, a dish of beans, some Ivar, a traditional pepper spread,</p><p>After walking home we walked through the local school yard where about 100 kids were playing in the near dusk, after an obviously hot day in the city. The kids played for about 10 minutes and then I took them up to bed file Sarah had a work meeting</p><h2 id=thursday-august-24-2023>Thursday, August 24, 2023</h2><p>On our last full day in SKOPJE, Sarah and I mixed a little bit of work time with school time for the kids. The kids were all a bit twitchy, and had a rougher time than usual concentrating on school work, and Max won our little game of &ldquo;whoever is the most efficient at getting their work done gets to go get coffee with dad&rdquo;.</p><p>We are breakfast and lunch at home on our last day, trying to finish up all the fresh food that we bought.</p><p>The kids had invented a fun game earlier in the week where they made a airplanes and loaded them with envelopes that they used to send a message to each other by flying them through the apartment. We all played that game before dinner</p><p>We ate out at a nice local restaurant that evening and treated ourselves to pizza, fish soup, pasta, a carrot, and arugula salad</p></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=text-capitalize><div class=container><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-12 border-top py-4 text-center"></div><div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-6 mb-5 text-center"><h6 class=mb-4>Contact Me</h6><ul class=list-unstyled><li class=mb-3><i class="ti-location-pin mr-3 text-primary"></i>Arizona, USA</li></li></ul></div><div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-6 mb-5 text-center"><h6 class=mb-4>External</h6><ul class=list-unstyled><li class=mb-3><a class=text-dark href=https://github.com/danb0b>personal github</a></li><li class=mb-3><a class=text-dark href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-aukes-502995212/>linkedin</a></li></ul></div><div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-6 mb-5 text-center"><h6 class=mb-4>Quick Links</h6><ul class=list-unstyled><li class=mb-3><a class=text-dark href=https://danaukes.com/about/>About</a></li><li class=mb-3><a class=text-dark href=https://idealab-asu.slack.com>IDEAlab Slack</a></li><li class=mb-3><a class=text-dark href=https://danaukes.com/contact/>Contact</a></li><li class=mb-3><a class=text-dark href=https://scram-workspace.slack.com>SCRAMbots</a></li><li class=mb-3><a class=text-dark href=https://danaukes.com/calendar/>Calendar</a></li><li class=mb-3><a class=text-dark href=https://kaiteki-asu.slack.com>Kaiteki</a></li></ul></div><div class="col-12 mb-5 text-center"><a href=https://danaukes.com><img src=https://danaukes.com/da-small.png alt="Dan Aukes"></a></div><div class="col-12 mb-5 text-center"><p>| copyright © 2023 Daniel Aukes.

We left Trebinje and drove into Montenegro.  The border crossing took about an hour; about 20 minutes to leave Bosnia, and about 40 minutes to enter Montenegro.  The checkpoints were about a mile or two apart.  We attempted to go to the Ostrog Monastery, but the line of cars going up the hill -- on a one-lane road, on a Sunday -- was too daunting considering our passengers.  We turned around and continued on, though we saw the monastery in the distance up along the cliff.  Still cool.

We made it into Cetinje and headed out of town towards Lovcen National park, the site of our AirBnB.  It took a while to find it due to some lagging communication but we eventually found it -- a lower floor apartment of a house that looks out upon fields and mountains.  Gorgeous!

We walked next door to the hotel and spent 2.5 hours ordering coffee, beer, letting the kids jump on the trampoline and play on the swingset, and, afterwards having dinner.  We walked up to the cafe up the hill for ice cream, then headed home.  Travel days are long.

Ben and sam woke up at about 6am hoping to play outside.  We made them wait till 7 to keep from waking the neighbors.  We had breakfast and the boys and I went on a 5-hour hike in the park.  Mom drove us to the trailhead, and after hiking back a bit to give her back the house keys, we headed up into stands of beech trees, then some limestone Karst.  We started seeing sinks, where the water obviously flows into the limestone, and started thinking about all the caves we must be walking over.  

I spotted one sinkhole with a gaping hole in the middle and investigated.  Walking back to the trail I found wild strawberries; then Sam found raspberries!  We stopped for a bit to eat them.

In and among the Karst, Sam found wild onions and we spotted some larger caves and crevices.  Continuing on, I looked at the map and saw a cave -- slightly off the main trail but accessible in my opinion.  We took an overgrown trail to it and slid down the slope to find the entrance.  It was massive.  The pictures don't do it justice, but it was quite a deep hole.   We scrambled back up and headed toward the town of Dolovi to meeet Mom.  Along the way, we turned a corner and found the coast, including the town of Radovici, Durasevici, Mrcevac, and Tivat, as well as an abandoned town.  We continued on, finding mom, eating lunch at about 1, and heading back to the car.  An amazing hike.

After we got home, we read and did school outside for a while, then had an early dinner at the local pizza place.  The kids played with a dog while we ordered.  We ate fast, mom and the kids had ice cream, and we headed home where the boys played more.

This is a great place...

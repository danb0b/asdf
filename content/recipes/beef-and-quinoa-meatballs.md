## Ingredients

* 1 pound (95-percent) lean ground beef
* 3/4 cup cooked quinoa (use frozen or cook it from scratch*)
* 1/4 cup finely chopped onion
* 1/4 cup grated carrot
* 1/4 cup grated zucchini
* 2 tablespoons ketchup
* 1 clove garlic minced
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
* 1 egg lightly beaten

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 450°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper; set aside.
1. In a large bowl, mix together all ingredients until well combined. Shape into 16 balls and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Roast until cooked through and golden brown, 15 to 17 minutes. Serve hot. 

## Note

To cook quinoa, bring 1 cup of water to a boil in a small pot. Pour in ½ cup quinoa, cover and simmer until water is absorbed, 10 to 12 minutes. Set aside off of the heat for 10 minutes then fluff with a fork. Makes about 1 1/2 cups. Use 3/4 cup in this recipe, and reserve the remaining for another use.

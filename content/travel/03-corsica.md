## Friday, July 14, 2023

We left our apartment around 7am, traveled from Genoa to Livorno by train, and then took a ferry from Livorno to Bastia, Corsica.  Erin arrived around 11:45, which was pretty tight for getting there by 1pm, and supposedly around a 40 minute walk (it would have been double that for our family, especially in the heat).  So we waited by the taxi stall and a taxi-van arrived just in time.  There are two different ferry docs in Livorno, which can get confusing.  Luckily, we went to the (correct) Corsica ferry pier, and our driver found our boat for us.  It couldn't have been smoother, but what if anything had gone wrong?

Ben made a good point that we used a lot of different modes of transportation yesterday:

1. Walk to train station
1. Train to Livorno
1. Taxi to Ferry
1. Ferry to Bastia
1. Taxi to Airport
1. Rental Car to Calvi

We found our AirBNB pretty easily.  Again, the host didn't reveal the true location until we were already in Calvi.  Is this the new normal?  If so, it is an annoying normal.  Erin and I walked into town to look for food, got pizzas and wine, brought them back, and had a short and fast dinner before bed.

title: Ros Tutorial
summary: Lab instructions for setting up ROS
---

The purpose of this project is to document our implementation of ROS and teach lab members how to use it for a number of purposes specific to the activities of a robotics lab like the IDEAlab.

In contrast with its name, ROS is not an operating system.  It is a way to have vast, disparate sources of data come together in networked way in order to perform tasks important to robotics, such as simulation, sensing, control, learning, and teleoperation.  It coordinates the transfer of information from one place to another in a way that is scalable

The idea of this section of my website is to document some of my daily work during my sabbatical year and hopefully onward.  

sometimes it's hard to organize my thoughts and plan out my work, so hopefully writing down my daily thoughts will help me organize my thoughts better.

Brainstorming some things I'd like to get done before the semester begins

* [ ] Dynamixel controller functionality
* [ ] ESP32 / ROS2 Functionality.
* [ ] I would like to go through the mujoco tutorials and create a small working example
  * [ ] add compliance
  * [ ] add model fitting
  * [ ] add design optimization
* [ ] begin a scaled down version of our quadruped for class
* [ ] locate rc servos
* [ ] Get Fuchen and Yuhao's walkers working and provide access to them in class
* [ ] ...

Projects for the year

* [ ] Fun project on turning images into triangulations
* [ ] Work on a textbook

This is incomplete... I will add to and refine my list as I keep thinking.

Longer-term questions:

*How can I continue to work on this stuff through my sabbatical with kids school, continued upheaval due to travel, and teaching obligations ramping up in Turkey and beyond?
* What is the point of all this?  What is my long term goal? 
* What will I do when sabbatical is over?

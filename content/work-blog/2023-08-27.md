This week I've been learning MuJoCo and have some informal things to share about what I've learned so far^[I'm talking about the python interface in this article.]:

1. There is an opportunity for a design-focused mujoco course / book / tutorial series to introduce people.
    - Mujoco's XML documentation doesn't serve as a full spec, and is not sufficient for most people to be able to understand its inner workings.
1. Few examples of good working dynamic robots exist in the wild
    * especially ones with built-in compliance, closed kinematic loops
    * good examples of implementing constraints for one or two bodies are hard to come by and don't span all the corner cases

That said, I've learned a couple important things so far:

* It seems that unless you can explicitly calculate a desired pose for your robot, it is hard to implement constraints between two bodies at anything other than the _XML-specified_, spawned initial position (I don't mean t=0).  
* So far, I don't know how to -- or whether it is possible to -- _declare_ your system using one set of coordinates, and then _initialize_ your system _in XML_ to a starting configuration.  So far it seems like you can only move joints in Python after the simulation has been imported and all constraints established.  

> This means, so far, that constraints must be consistent with the way the robot is declared in XML.

More on this soon.

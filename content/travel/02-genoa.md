Monday July 10th

We woke up and packed our bags in preparation for checking out.  Our Airbnb hosts met us at 9:45 and offered to take some of our bags down to the bus stop.  It was a very pleasant stay.

I went with the car, and when Sarah and the kids arrived down the hill she asked, did you bring the sandwiches? We looked at each other and after looking at the bus schedule she ran back up the hill and returned just as our bus was getting ready to go.  So much for staying cool.

We made it to the train station and couldn't get on the first train, but the second one was only 15 minutes behind.  We switched trains in ventmiglia.  The Italian train was off when we got on an incredibly hot.  It took one whole stop before the electricity came on and the AC started to run.

I also tested how well my international phone plan worked as we cross the border. After restarting my phone it clicked into Italian service with no problems.

This place is precisely what is bad about Airbnb these days.  It's managed by an impersonal management company that has no flexibility, and is doing the most it can to do the least work possible.  They manage your check-in, arrival, and messaging through their own independent portal, including a requirement for you to scan all your passports.  I don't really want scans of our passports just sitting out there on the web on some random third-party server, so I had to spend extra time to watermark all the images before uploading them.

They don't give you  location or check-in information until two and a half hours before check in.  We were traveling for the first couple days without a SIM and so it would have been difficult to get the instructions in the morning before we left.

The key to the place requires Wi-Fi which for an international traveler may not be easy to get either.

Their correspondence with us has been overly commercial, trying to hook us into the other services divided by them or their "partners"

And this was before we even got there!

## Ingredients

* Mashed potatoes
* Egg
* Salt
* All purpose flour

## Directions

1. I had some leftover mashed potatoes from last night's dinner and there's no better way to use them than making potato dumplings!
1. Add a little bit more salt to your mashies. For my amount I used two eggs and a little bit of milk. Add some flour and start mixing it in.
1. Keep adding more flour. As soon as it turns to sort-of-dough consistency, dump it on your counter and work it with your hands. (Don't forget to keep adding flour.)
1. Yup, now it finally looks like dough!
1. I'm gonna make one big dumpling that I'm gonna freeze for later. The big ones are being cooked whole and then sliced to go with foods like Goulash :)
1. Wrap it up in foil to freeze it, or you can cook it and eat it or freeze it. Because of the differences in flour, it's better to cook it in the foil, so it keeps the right shape.
1. Now make a "cylinder" with a part of your dough and cut it up like I did.
1. I'm sure yours are gonna look way better than mine. I'm an awesome theoretical cook, but when it comes to aesthetics, it never comes out like I pictured it in my head :)
1. Now throw them in salted boiling water! They're good to go as soon as they start floating on the surface.
1. Yup... I wish they looked at least half good as my mom's and grandma's dumplings. But they sure tasted better though (grandma makes them too firm, these just dissolved in my mouth :))
1. I was baking some chicken breast on butter with just salt, pepper and little mustard on the top. As a side I also cooked some spinach on butter with an egg. Approved by my man, said it was yummy :)

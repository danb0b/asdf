## Ingredients

### Crepes

-   6 Tbsp unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
-   1 Tbsp unsalted butter for pan
-   3/4 cup + 2 Tbsp all-purpose flour
-   1/4 cup sugar
-   1/4 cup salt
-   1 1/4 cup milk (not skim)
-   3 large eggs

### Sauce

-   1 cup sugar
-   3 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
-   1 tablespoon limoncello (Italian lemon-flavored liqueur; optional)
-   2 Tbsp unsalted butter, cut into small pieces

### Candied Lemons

-   1 large lemon
-   1 cup sugar

## Directions

The crepes can be made one day ahead and refrigerated, wrapped in plastic wrap. To reheat, wrap them in foil and warm in a 200 degree oven.

### Crepes

1.  Bring 2 Tbsp water to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce heat; add 6 tablespoons butter, a little at a time, whisking until butter is completely melted.
2.  Whisk together flour, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together milk, vanilla, and eggs. Gradually add milk mixture to flour mixture, whisking until smooth. Whisk in butter mixture. Pour batter through a fine sieve into a bowl; discard lumps. Transfer batter to an airtight container; refrigerate at least 2 hours (or overnight).
3.  Preheat oven to 200 deg. Lightly coat a 6-7 inch crepe pan or nonstick skillet with melted butter. Heat over medium heat until just starting to smoke. Remove pan from heat; pour 2 to 3 tablespoons batter (depending on size of pan) in center. Swirl to cover bottom. Reduce heat to medium-low; return pan to heat. Cook until edges of crepe turn golden and center is dry, about 45 seconds. Flip crepe; cook until underside is brown in spots, about 45 seconds more.
4.  Slide crepe onto an ovenproof plate; cover with foil and transfer to oven. Repeat process with remaining batter, coating pan with more butter as needed.
5.  Fold each crepe into quarters to form a triangle. Arrange 3 crepes on each plate; drizzle with lemon-caramel sauce and garnish with candied lemon slices.

### Lemon-Caramel Sauce

The sauce can be refrigerated in an airtight container up to three days. Gently reheat it just before serving.

1.  Heat sugar and 1/4 cup water in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar has dissolved and syrup is clear. Continue to cook, without stirring, until syrup comes to a boil, occasionally washing down sides of pan with a wet pastry brush to prevent crystals from forming. Let syrup boil, gently swirling pan occasionally, until dark amber.
2.  Remove from heat; whisk in lemon juice, liqueur, butter, and 2 tablespoons water. (Caramel will steam and spatter) Serve warm

### Candied Lemon Slices

The lemon slices can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature up to one day

1.  Prepare an ice-water bath; set aside. Using a mandolin or sharp knife, cut lemon into 12 paper-thin slices; discard seeds and ends of rind.
2.  Bring a medium saucepan of water to a rolling boil. Remove from heat, and add lemon slices; stir until softened, about 1 minute. Drain, and immediately plunge slices into ice-water bath. Drain.
3.  Bring sugar and 1 cup water to a boil in a medium skillet, swirling to dissolve sugar. When liquid is clear and bubbling, reduce heat to medium-low. Add lemon slices, arranging them in one layer with tongs. Simmer (do not let boil) until rinds are translucent, about 1 hour.
4.  Transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment. Let stand until ready to serve.

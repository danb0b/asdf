## Ingredients

* 2 cup flour, sifted if possible
* 1 tsp salt
* 2/3 cup butter, room temp
* 5-7 tbsp water

## Directions

1. cut butter into flour until butter reaches the size of small peas.
1. throw 1 tbsp of water into part of bowl and very lightly mix into flour with a fork, seperating from dry mix.
1. continue until all the flour has been watered; about 5-7 tbsp is enough for all.
1. separate dough into two balls, then roll flat on wax paper, keeping dough floured to prevent it from sticking to the paper.
1. line pie tin with dough, cutting off edges at about 1" beyond tin.

## Notes

Makes 2 pie crusts or one top and one bottom crust.

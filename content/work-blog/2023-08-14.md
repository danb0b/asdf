I'm slowly trying to merge some existing servo code with a micro web framework called microdot in order to be able to encode "gait" parameters from a webpage on an ESP32.

The trick is to use the ```uasync``` library to create a separate task and to share gait variables between the two.

This will be used in class eventually.

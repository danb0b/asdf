Leaving Alpeta winery and heading south, we stopped first at the site of Apollinia, an archaeological site on the way to Gjirokaster.  It was great to be able to walk the site with few tourists and take our time.  But travel days are hard, and kids have only so much attention, so we moved on.  We got to Gjirokaster in the afternoon, and, after a scary drive up a cobbled street, we found our hotel conveniently located in the center of the city's bazaar.  It was a great place, though perhaps a little noisy at night for a family with kids.  Still, the location was perfect.  Sara dumped the car, we unloaded, and we found dinner in a little place up the street from the bazaar with great views and a wide range of traditional Albanian food.  We went back to the hotel and  listened to the thumping bass of the downstairs Irish bar until 11:30pm.

Breakfast was great

We did school in the morning, then walked to a cafe halfway up to the castle.  We came down afterwards instead of going to the castle just due to timing, then walked instead to the cold war bunker underneath the castle.  It was a 30 minute tour, and we got to see a good portion of the bunker.  Apparently some parts of it were in poor condition and had collapsed, but our section was "much stronger".  Still, neat to see evidence of Albania's cold war past hasn't all disappeared.

* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/8 teaspoon salt
* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter melted
* scant 1/2 cup all purpose flour

### Muffins

* 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour see note
* 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice
* 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 2 large eggs
* 2/3 cup light brown sugar
* 1/3 cup canola, vegetable or melted coconut oil

* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Cinnamon icing

* 5 tablespoons powdered sugar
* 1-2 teaspoons milk more, if needed
* 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
 
## Directions


### For the crumb topping

In a medium bowl, combine sugars, cinnamon, salt, and melted butter. Whisk until combined. Add flour, and stir until the flour is combined. Set aside.

### For the muffins

Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Grease a 12 cup muffin tin, or line with paper liners.
In a medium bowl, combine flour, cinnamon/spice, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
In a large bowl, whisk eggs, brown sugar, oil, pumpkin puree and vanilla, until combined. Add flour mixture, and stir until combined (I use a rubber spatula), being careful not to over-mix.
Divide the batter between 12 muffin cups. Pinch off small pieces of the crumb topping and scatter them over the tops of each muffin. Bake for approximately 20 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of the muffins comes out clean. Place the pan on a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes, then remove the muffins from the pan and place on the rack to cool completely.

### For the icing
Whisk all ingredients until smooth. Adjust the consistency by adding more powdered sugar (to thicken) or more milk (to thin). Use a small spoon to drizzle icing over the tops of the cooled muffins.

### Notes
Feel free to swap up to half of the all purpose flour for white whole wheat flour.

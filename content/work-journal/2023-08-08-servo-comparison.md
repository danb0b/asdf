title: Servo Comparison

One of the issues with low cost RC servos is their vastly different characteristics.  When I'm developing a course or camp, I often don't have time to do in-depth research on parts or to pre-order multiple rounds of test parts in order to properly research what Ineed.

However, RC servo motors -- to a robotics professor like me -- are one of the cornerstones to teaching half of the sensing & actuation loop so often required of a robotic or embedded system.
If the servo doesn't work right, there is a learning gap.  So, over the years, as I've hit the challenge of 
"how do you find cheap (and I mean _cheap_) rc servos that can survive for a week or even a semester, that behave nicely when you try to use 4-6 of them off the same low power microcontroller?"

Tis is harder than it might seem.  RC servo motors are incredibly complex systems, if you think about it.  They include a housing, a transmission usually composed of multiple gear stages, a motor, feedback, and often a microcontroller or circuit-based control scheme to provide feedback

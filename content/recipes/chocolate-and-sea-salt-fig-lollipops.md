## Ingredients
* 1 cup bittersweet chocolate baking wafers, such as Guittard, or bittersweet chocolate chips
* 4 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
* 12 figs, preferably a mix of green and black varieties (See "6 Figs to Try," below), stems trimmed
* 1 teaspoon flaked sea salt, such as Jacobsen

## Directions

1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. Combine chocolate and oil in a 2-cup glass measuring cup and microwave, stirring every 30 seconds, until smooth and liquidy, about 1 minute total.
1. Dip bottom of each fig in a little chocolate to coat and set on lined baking sheet. Working with one at a time, dip skewers about 1 1/2 in. into chocolate and pierce top of fig with chocolate-dipped stick. Chill until chocolate firms and sticks adhere to figs, about 20 minutes.
1. If needed, microwave measuring cup of chocolate in 15-second increments just until thick but pourable. Lift 1 fig from paper and dip all but top third into chocolate, letting excess drip off. Return fig to lined baking sheet and sprinkle chocolate with salt. Repeat with remaining figs.
1. Chill figs until chocolate hardens, 10 to 15 minutes more.

## Note

Make ahead: Up to 4 hours, chilled.

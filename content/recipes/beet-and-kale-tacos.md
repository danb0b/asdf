## INGREDIENTS

### Filling

* 8–12 small corn tortillas
* 6 medium beets cooked* (3 cups diced)
* 6–8 kale leaves (3–4 cups chopped)
* 1 Tbsp. olive oil
* 4 ounces goat cheese
* salt
* lime wedges for garnish (optional)

### For the Sauce:

* 1 avocado
* 1 jalapeño
* 1 small handful cilantro (1/3 cup)
* 1/2 cup milk
* 1 Tbsp lime juice (juice from 1/2 lime)

## Directions

1. Prep the Ingredients: Remove the stems from the kale leaves, chop the leaves into small pieces and place the chopped kale in a medium sized bowl. Cut the cooked beets into cubes (1/2″ cubes work well) and put in the medium sized bowl with the kale. Gently toss the kale and beets with the olive oil and a couple pinches of salt. Set aside.
1. Make the Sauce: Remove the stem, ribs and seeds from the jalapeño. Cut the avocado in half, remove the pit and use a spoon to scoop the avocado out of the skin. Put the avocado, jalapeño, cilantro, milk, lime juice and 1/2 tsp. of salt in a small food processor, blender or bullet. Blend until all the ingredients are well combined.
1. Assemble: Warm the tortillas in the microwave for 10 seconds to make them more pliable. Now it is time to assemble your tacos! Put beets, kale, goat cheese and a couple spoonfuls of avocado sauce in each taco. Serve with lime wedges for a fresh zesty squeeze of lime juice over the tacos (optional). Enjoy!

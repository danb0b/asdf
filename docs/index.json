The tender texture, fun factor and comforting flavors of these healthy bites is not.\nIngredients  1 Tablespoon Butter 1 cup Finely Chopped Yellow Onion 2 cups Finely Chopped Green Swiss Chard Or Spinach Leaves (not Packed) 4 cups Finely Chopped Green Or Black Kale Leaves (not Packed) ½ teaspoons Fine Sea Salt Granules 4 whole Scallions (white And Light Green Parts), Minced ½ cups Panko Dry Bread Crumbs ½ cups Finely Grated Parmesan Cheese (plus An Extra 1 To 2 Tablespoons, For Baking) ¼ teaspoons Grated Nutmeg 2 Tablespoons Prepared Green Pesto (homemade Or Store Bought) ¾ teaspoons Ground White Pepper 2 whole Large Eggs 1 whole Lemon, Cut Into Wedges (optional, For Serving)  Directions  Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat, then add onions and cook until just softened but not brown, about 10 minutes. Add greens and half of the salt and continue to cook and stir until completely wilted, another 10 minutes, keeping heat low enough so onions do not brown. Remove from heat and cool for 5 minutes. Stir in scallions, panko, Parmesan, nutmeg, and pesto. Taste mixture (before adding eggs) and season, starting with ¼ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper and adjusting to taste (I used ¾ teaspoon pepper and the flavor was quite prominent, if you’re into lots of pepper). Stir in eggs, breaking up yolks and combining completely into a uniform mixture. Heat oven to 375 F (if baking immediately) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll the mixture into balls of 1½ tablespoons each and place on baking sheet. Sprinkle the top of each ball with a pinch of grated Parmesan. To bake immediately: Bake about 20 minutes in the upper third of the oven, until completely cooked through (no liquid egg inside) and browned on the bottom. When done, the puffs will spring back when squeezed lightly. To freeze: Place the un-baked tray of balls in the freezer, covered loosely with plastic wrap, until balls are frozen through, about 2 hours. Remove balls from sheet and store in a freezer bag or another airtight, freezer safe container. To bake, follow directions above. Thawing not necessary—just add 5 minutes to the cook time above (25 minutes total).  Notes:  Makes 20 puffs, about 4 to 6 appetizer servings. I think these would be a really fun brunch appetizer! In testing, I used Swiss chard and green kale (the fluffy, curly one). If substituting other varieties of greens, use something mild and tender in place of the chard or spinach, and something sturdy, and possibly slightly bitter, in place of the kale. Refrigerating the mixture (right in the pan; for 15 to 30 minutes) before forming balls helps it to firm up, making it even easier to handle. I tried it warm and refrigerated, without issues either way. If making for a strict vegetarian, make sure the pesto and Parmesan do not contain animal rennet. Varieties that work will likely be labeled “vegetarian”.

If you are using a solid top crust, score the top several times with a sharp knife to create air vents for the steam to escape. Bake: Place the pie on the middle rack of the oven. Put a baking sheet on the lower rack to catch any juices that might bubble out of the pie while it\u0026rsquo;s cooking. Bake the pie in two stages. First bake it at 400°F for 30 minutes. Then place a sheet of aluminum foil over the pie to protect the edges and tops from getting too burnt. (A pie protector is quite useful here.) Reduce the heat to 350°F and bake for an additional 30 minutes, or until the crust has browned and the filling is bubbly. Remove from oven and place on a wire rack. Cool completely before serving.

While steaming prepare meat mixture. Watch and once it is steamed removed and drain water off and let sit with lid on to keep moist. This can be made ahead of time so the flavors will do their thing. I made it the day before and let it set all night in the refrigerator. Combine both meats, onion, rice, garlic \u0026amp; salt and pepper and mix well. Spape your meat mixture into rolls about as long as your index finger and 3/4\u0026quot; in diameter. Wrap your rolled meat mixture in one leaf of your steamed cabbage. Start by putting down a layer of saurkraut on the bottom of your stew kettle/dutch oven, then place a layer of cabbage rolls and continue to do this (2-3 layers is what I had) and you should end up at the top with a layer for saurkraut. Pour your broth (or water) over the top and season more if desired with salt \u0026amp; pepper. Once you are done place on your back burner, cover with lid, and bring to a boil. Once it\u0026rsquo;s boiling lower to simmer, continue with lid still on, and continue for 2-1/2 hours. It is okay to let it sit in the juice as it just give it more flavor.

Add a little bit more salt to your mashies. For my amount I used two eggs and a little bit of milk. Add some flour and start mixing it in. Keep adding more flour. As soon as it turns to sort-of-dough consistency, dump it on your counter and work it with your hands. (Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to keep adding flour.) Yup, now it finally looks like dough! I\u0026rsquo;m gonna make one big dumpling that I\u0026rsquo;m gonna freeze for later. The big ones are being cooked whole and then sliced to go with foods like Goulash :) Wrap it up in foil to freeze it, or you can cook it and eat it or freeze it. Because of the differences in flour, it\u0026rsquo;s better to cook it in the foil, so it keeps the right shape.

Gently stir to wash the figs, then drain off the water and rinse the figs thoroughly with fresh cool water. Place the figs into a large pot. Add 1 cup water, sugar, butter, vanilla extract, lemon, lemon juice, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves. Very gently stir the mixture to dissolve the sugar, keeping the figs intact as much as possible. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat; reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the figs are golden brown and coated in syrup, about 1 hour. Stir gently a couple of times to keep the figs from burning onto the bottom of the pot. Add a pinch of salt, if desired, to tame the sweetness. Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the figs into the hot, sterilized jars and top off with syrup, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2 inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 15 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area, and wait at least 2 days before opening. Place the whole figs in the pot, and let them break apart naturally, do not cut them in half. If you do not seal jars in boiling water, the mixture must be eaten in 30 days.

Don\u0026rsquo;t let the water and butter boil away while you grate the cheese. Second is to let the batter cool for a few minutes before adding the eggs so you don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026lsquo;cook\u0026rsquo; them. Make sure when you stir in the eggs that you do it vigorously. 1. Preheat the oven to 425F (220C.) Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 2. Heat the water, butter, salt, and chile in a saucepan until the butter is melted. 3. Dump in the flour all at once and stir vigorously until the mixture pulls away from the sides into a smooth ball. Remove from heat and let rest two minutes. 4. Add the eggs, one at a time, stirring quickly to make sure the eggs don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026lsquo;cook.\u0026rsquo; The batter will first appear lumpy, but it will smooth out. 5. Add about 3/4s of the grated cheese and the chives, and stir until well-mixed. 6. Scrape the mixture into a pastry bag pipe the dough into mounds, evenly-spaced apart, making each about the size of a small cherry tomato. 7. Top each puff with a bit of the remaining cheese, then pop the baking sheet in the oven. 8. Bake for 10 minutes, then turn the oven down to 375F (190C) and bake for an additional 20 to 25 minutes, until they\u0026rsquo;re completely golden brown. Serving: The puffs are best served warm, and if making them in advance, you can simply pipe the gougères on baking sheets and cook right before your guests arrive, or reheat the baked cheese puffs in a low oven for 5-10 minutes before serving. A bit of troubleshooting: The problem folks have with pâte à choux is them being deflated. The usual causes are too much liquid (eggs), or underbaking. Make sure to use large eggs, not extra-large or jumbo. And bake the puffs until they\u0026rsquo;re completely browned up the sides so they don\u0026rsquo;t sink when cooling.\n","permalink":"https://danaukes.com/recipes/french-cheese-puffs/","tags":null,"title":"French Cheese Puffs"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Ingredients Sesame Noodles 1 lb spaghettini (get the thinnest spaghetti you can find) 1⁄2 cup soy sauce 1⁄4 cup sesame oil (some reviewers have said that 1/2 cup of oil is too much and have halved the amount, so use your own) 1⁄3 cup sugar 3 scallions, thinly sliced 1⁄4 cup sesame seeds (or more)\nFunkey Chicken 1⁄4 cup soy sauce 1⁄4 cup teriyaki sauce 2 garlic cloves, minced 1⁄4 cup brown sugar 1 teaspoon fresh ginger, chopped (or 1/4 teaspoon dried) 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts sesame oil, for sauteing\nDirections  First make the sesame noodles: Cook the spaghetti according to package directions.

Put all the ingredients into a baking pan large enough to hold them. Season generously with sea salt and black pepper. Make sure your hands are very clean and put them in the pan and give everything a toss to distribute. The garlic will drop into the water/oil solution but its flavour will permeate the potatoes, and this way, it won\u0026rsquo;t burn. Bake for 40 minutes. When a nice golden-brown crust has formed on the potatoes, give them a stir to bring the white underside up, season lightly with a bit more sea salt and pepper and just a light sprinkling of oregano. Add 1/2 cup more water if pan appears to be getting dry, and pop back into oven to brown other side of potatoes. This will take about another 40 minutes. Do not be afraid of overcooking the potatoes- they will be delicious. Note: I often melt a bouillon cube in the water; if you do, make sure to cut back some on the salt.

To reheat, wrap them in foil and warm in a 200 degree oven.\nCrepes  Bring 2 Tbsp water to a boil in a small saucepan. Reduce heat; add 6 tablespoons butter, a little at a time, whisking until butter is completely melted. Whisk together flour, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together milk, vanilla, and eggs. Gradually add milk mixture to flour mixture, whisking until smooth. Whisk in butter mixture. Pour batter through a fine sieve into a bowl; discard lumps. Transfer batter to an airtight container; refrigerate at least 2 hours (or overnight). Preheat oven to 200 deg. Lightly coat a 6-7 inch crepe pan or nonstick skillet with melted butter. Heat over medium heat until just starting to smoke. Remove pan from heat; pour 2 to 3 tablespoons batter (depending on size of pan) in center. Swirl to cover bottom. Reduce heat to medium-low; return pan to heat. Cook until edges of crepe turn golden and center is dry, about 45 seconds. Flip crepe; cook until underside is brown in spots, about 45 seconds more. Slide crepe onto an ovenproof plate; cover with foil and transfer to oven. Repeat process with remaining batter, coating pan with more butter as needed. Fold each crepe into quarters to form a triangle. Arrange 3 crepes on each plate; drizzle with lemon-caramel sauce and garnish with candied lemon slices.  Lemon-Caramel Sauce The sauce can be refrigerated in an airtight container up to three days. Gently reheat it just before serving.\n Heat sugar and 1/4 cup water in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar has dissolved and syrup is clear. Continue to cook, without stirring, until syrup comes to a boil, occasionally washing down sides of pan with a wet pastry brush to prevent crystals from forming. Let syrup boil, gently swirling pan occasionally, until dark amber. Remove from heat; whisk in lemon juice, liqueur, butter, and 2 tablespoons water. (Caramel will steam and spatter) Serve warm  Candied Lemon Slices The lemon slices can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature up to one day\n Prepare an ice-water bath; set aside. Using a mandolin or sharp knife, cut lemon into 12 paper-thin slices; discard seeds and ends of rind. Bring a medium saucepan of water to a rolling boil. Remove from heat, and add lemon slices; stir until softened, about 1 minute. Drain, and immediately plunge slices into ice-water bath. Drain. Bring sugar and 1 cup water to a boil in a medium skillet, swirling to dissolve sugar. When liquid is clear and bubbling, reduce heat to medium-low.

We can use Markdown or HTML or an alternative syntax to create our desired headings.\nFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the markdown syntax.\n# Heading 1 ## Heading 2 ### Heading 3 #### Heading 4 ##### Heading 5  The second option, using the HTML syntax.\n\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Heading 1\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;Heading 2\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;Heading 3\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;Heading 4\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h5\u0026gt;Heading 5\u0026lt;/h5\u0026gt;  Finally, we can use an alternate syntax. This method only works for heading 1 and heading 2. Add any number of = or - below the text for heading 1 or heading 2.\nHeading 1 = Heading 2 -  Now, let\u0026rsquo;s see how it looks on GitHub.\nHeading 1 Heading 2 Text styles Using markdown syntax, we can change texts' styles, including bold, italic, blockquotes, monospaced, underlined, strike-through, boxed, subscript, and superscript.\nWe can use two asterisks (**), underscores (__), or an HTML tag \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt; to make a text bold. To make text italic, we can use one asterisk (*), underscore (_), or an HTML tag \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;. Also, we can make the text bold and italic at the same time.\nBold\n**The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.** __The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.__ \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;  Italic\n*The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.* _The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog._ \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;  Bold and Italic\n**_The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog._** \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;  Now, let\u0026rsquo;s see how it looks on GitHub.\nBold\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nItalic\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nBold and Italic\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nTo create blockquote, we can use the greater than sign \u0026gt;. We can create a single-line or multi-line blockquote. Also, blockquote inside a blockquote. We can add other text styles inside a blockquote, such as bold or italic text styles.\nBlockquotes \u0026gt; The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\u0026gt; The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. \u0026gt; \u0026gt; The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. \u0026gt; \u0026gt; The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\u0026gt; The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. \u0026gt;\u0026gt; The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\u0026gt; **The quick brown fox** *jumps over the lazy dog.*  Now, let\u0026rsquo;s see how it looks on GitHub.\n The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\u0026gt; The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\u0026gt; The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\n The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\n The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\u0026gt; The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\n   We can achieve monospaced, and underlined styles using HTML tags \u0026lt;samp\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;ins\u0026gt;. For a strike-through style, we can use two tilda sign ~~.\nMonospaced: \u0026lt;samp\u0026gt;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\u0026lt;/samp\u0026gt; Underlined: \u0026lt;ins\u0026gt;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\u0026lt;/ins\u0026gt; Strike-through: ~~The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.~~  Now, let\u0026rsquo;s see how it looks on GitHub.\nMonospaced: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nUnderlined: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nStrike-through: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\nWe can use an HTML \u0026lt;table\u0026gt; tag to create a box.\nBoxed \u0026lt;table\u0026gt;\u0026lt;tr\u0026gt;\u0026lt;td\u0026gt;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\u0026lt;/td\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/tr\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/table\u0026gt;  Now, let\u0026rsquo;s see how it looks on GitHub.\nThe quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. We can achieve subscript and superscript styles using HTML tag \u0026lt;sub\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;.

When a new class is created, an object of type `Class` is initialized and assigned to a global constant (Mobile in this case).  As you can see the word Class is highlighted.\nWe can also use triple backticks ``` before and after the code block to create the following view.\n``` public static String monthNames[] = {\u0026quot;January\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;February\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;March\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;April\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;May\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;June\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;July\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;August\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;September\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;October\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;November\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;December\u0026quot;};```  We can add an optional language identifier to enable syntax highlighting. Refer to this GitHub document to find all the valid keywords.\n```java public static String monthNames[] = {\u0026quot;January\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;February\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;March\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;April\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;May\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;June\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;July\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;August\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;September\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;October\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;November\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;December\u0026quot;};```  Now, let\u0026rsquo;s see how it looks on GitHub.\nAlignments By using HTML tags, we can align README contents.\n\u0026lt;p align=\u0026quot;left\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1415604934674-561df9abf539?ixlib=rb-1.2.1\u0026amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=2772\u0026amp;q=80\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;100\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;100\u0026quot; border=\u0026quot;10\u0026quot;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p align=\u0026quot;center\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1415604934674-561df9abf539?ixlib=rb-1.2.1\u0026amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=2772\u0026amp;q=80\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;100\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;100\u0026quot; border=\u0026quot;10\u0026quot;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;p align=\u0026quot;right\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1415604934674-561df9abf539?ixlib=rb-1.2.1\u0026amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=2772\u0026amp;q=80\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;100\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;100\u0026quot; border=\u0026quot;10\u0026quot;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;  Now, let\u0026rsquo;s align a text.\n\u0026lt;h3 align=\u0026quot;center\u0026quot;\u0026gt; My latest Medium posts \u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;  Tables Let\u0026rsquo;s create a table without headers.\n\u0026lt;table\u0026gt; \u0026lt;tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td width=”33%””\u0026gt; The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. \u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td width=”33%”\u0026gt; The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. \u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td width=”33%”\u0026gt; The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. \u0026lt;/td\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/table\u0026gt;  To create a table with headers we need to use dashes to separate each header cell and use pipes to separate columns. The outer pipes are optional. We can use any number of dashes and spaces to increase readability. We can use colons to align columns. For left-align text, use a colon to the left of dashes. For center-align text, use a colon on both sides of dashes. For right-align text, use a colon to the right of dashes. By default Left align is used.\n| Default | Left align | Center align | Right align | | - | :- | :-: | -: | | 9999999999 | 9999999999 | 9999999999 | 9999999999 | | 999999999 | 999999999 | 999999999 | 999999999 | | 99999999 | 99999999 | 99999999 | 99999999 | | 9999999 | 9999999 | 9999999 | 9999999 || Default | Left align | Center align | Right align | | ---------- | :--------- | :----------: | ----------: | | 9999999999 | 9999999999 | 9999999999 | 9999999999 | | 999999999 | 999999999 | 999999999 | 999999999 | | 99999999 | 99999999 | 99999999 | 99999999 |  | 9999999 | 9999999 | 9999999 | 9999999 |Default | Left align | Center align | Right align | |:\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026ndash;|:\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026ndash;|:\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;-:|\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;:| | 9999999999 | 9999999999 | 9999999999 | 9999999999 | | 999999999 | 999999999 | 999999999 | 999999999 | | 99999999 | 99999999 | 99999999 | 99999999 | | 9999999 | 9999999 | 9999999 | 9999999 |\nNow display two tables side by side.\n\u0026lt;table\u0026gt; \u0026lt;tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;th\u0026gt;Heading 1\u0026lt;/th\u0026gt; \u0026lt;th\u0026gt;Heading 2\u0026lt;/th\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;td\u0026gt; | A | B | C | |--|--|--| | 1 | 2 | 3 | \u0026lt;/td\u0026gt;\u0026lt;td\u0026gt; | A | B | C | |--|--|--| | 1 | 2 | 3 | \u0026lt;/td\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/tr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/table\u0026gt;  Let\u0026rsquo;s create a table with multiple lines using the HTML \u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; tag.\n| A | B | C | |---|---|---| | 1 | 2 | 3 \u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; 5 |  Links We can create a link in four ways.

It does a great job of waking up the other things it’s served with – a few spoonfuls of this next to a grilled chicken breast or pork chop would be an absolute celebration. Veg-wise, the onion, coriander and white cabbage are non-negotiable, as they form the base of this salad, but feel free to have a play with the other ingredients and use things like fennel or asparagus. Basically whatever’s in season and available should be a nice addition. The easiest and quickest way to make this is to use a food processor with a slicer attachment or a mandolin. If you don’t have either of those, use a speed peeler, or simply grate everything finely. Shred your white and red cabbage into two separate piles. Put just the white cabbage into a large bowl with the radishes, carrots and most of the coriander. Mix everything together really well, then kick up the flavours by adding almost all the chopped chilli, the sliced red onion and a good few lugs of extra virgin olive oil. Add most of the lime juice and a good pinch of sea salt, then toss together and have a taste. Just keep adjusting everything, adding more fragrance with the coriander, heat with the last of the chilli and acid with another squeeze of lime juice, until it’s just right for you. When you’re happy, fold in the red cabbage right before serving so it doesn’t stain everything, and tuck in.

It is a way to have vast, disparate sources of data come together in networked way in order to perform tasks important to robotics, such as simulation, sensing, control, learning, and teleoperation. It coordinates the transfer of information from one place to another in a way that is scalable\nIntegration The IDEAlab has a number of disparate pieces of hardware, each of which is controlled using a mix of standardized and proprietary protocols. It is important to be able to access that data in a standardized way so that we can run experiments more efficiently\nEach device typically has an API or protocol that we can use to communicate with it, but these protocols are not standardized (nor should they be). In the past, when creating experimental data collection setups, we would write individual Matlab or Python-based scripts to communicate with the specific devices we needed. This led to non-standardized code with situation-specific instructions making it difficult to reuse the code for new purposes, limiting sharing. Secondly, as multiple devices were often integrated together within some sort of while loop, communication from multiple sources at different rates led to common problems with buffering and asynchronous communication, leading to poor performance. Through ROS, we have more control over each devices communication rate in a way that is non-blocking and variable depending on need.\nHigh Level Overview There are a variety of terms used for the parts of ROS, and while there are good tutorials out there, it is nice to see a quick summary of terms in one place.\n   Item Description     Master the computer that coordinates communication sent over ROS   Node A node is a program compiled to interact with ros topics. Nodes can be run on different PC\u0026rsquo;s and communicate over communication layer   Service Like a node, except that services respond to requests rather than publish at their own discretion   Message particular data type that gets passed between nodes   Topic A category of messages that a node can subscribe to   Package collections of nodes, messages, and data types that work together as a project. They are written in python and/or C++   launch file a method for starting up a number of ros nodes, services and topics. synchronizes the startup of ros stuff   publish how to send data over ROS   subscribe how to select and receive data published over ROS    Devices Some examples of the types of devices we need to communicate with include:\n Ethernet-based data from standalone robotic systems  UR-5 and UR-5e Wifi-based microcontrollers suh as the Photon. ATI LAN-based sensors   Camera data from USB webcams or ethernet-accessible computers like the Raspberry Pi. Ethernet-based motion tracking systems like Optitrack. USB-based devices connected to a local or remote computer  Novint Falcon Thorlabs Linear Stage Serial over USB data to/from microcontrollers connected to a computer, for custom sensing  Accelerometer Data from I2C based chips Current data from current sensing chips Analog data from I/O pins   Dynamixel Servos Load Cells   PCI-card-based devices with drivers available only in Windows, like NI hardware etc\u0026hellip;  The variety of these devices, their connection to a computer, and their specific constraints, is the reason we have chosen ROS for our integration effort. We have determined that ROS can satisfy those needs while remaining relatively accessible to students in terms of the learning curve and complexity.\nROS Capabilities ROS is capable of performing a number of tasks critical for robotics research\nData Collection Once routed into ROS, it is important to select which pieces of data to gather, process and publish. Our needs at this point are mostly related to collection, processing, filtering, and recording that data. Future work will relate to closing the loop with control.\nData Processing Data can be processed within the ROS environment. One standard way to do that would be to have a separate node \u0026ndash; a program that runs within its own process \u0026ndash; subscribing to a stream of data, doing something with it, and then publishing a derivative of that work. Examples include\n taking camera data from two cameras and to combine it into a 3d image. filtering noisy sensor data compressing an image extracting raw load cell data and converting it into a resultant force and location.  Recording Data can also be recorded using ROS, by subscribing to different topics and logging everything as it comes in into a \u0026ldquo;bag\u0026rdquo; file.

Place the cabbage on a clean dishtowel or cheesecloth and squeeze out any water. The dryer the cabbage the better. In a large bowl thoroughly mix the cabbage with all of the other ingredients, except the chicken stock. Cook a tester to check the seasoning.;  Hot Water Dough  In a stainless steel bowl mix flour and salt. Slowly add hot water to flour in 1/4 cup increments. Mix with chopsticks until a ball is formed and the dough is not too hot to handle. On a floured surface, knead dough until it becomes a smooth, elastic ball. Place back in bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rest for at least 1 hour. Working on a floured surface with floured hands, roll out dough to form a long \u0026lsquo;noodle\u0026rsquo;, 1-inch in diameter. Cut 1/2-inch pieces and turn them over so the cut sides are facing up. Flatten with your palm and roll out thin using a rolling pin. The dumpling wrapper should end up about 3 inches in diameter.  MAKING THE DUMPLINGS:  Place a small mound of filling in the middle of the wrapper. (Be very careful not to touch the edges with the filling as this will impede proper sealing of the dumplings. Nothing is worse than dumplings breaking during cooking.) Fold the wrapper in half to form a half moon shape. Starting on one end fold/pinch the wrapper tightly together. Proceed with this fold/pinch method until the dumpling is completely sealed. There will be approximately 10 to 14 folds per dumpling. Rest the dumplings with the folded edges straight up.  COOKING THE DUMPLINGS  In a hot saute pan coated well with oil, place pot stickers flat side down and cook until the bottom is browned. Have pan cover ready and add 1 cup of chicken stock, cover immediately. Be careful, the liquid will splatter! The stock will steam the pot stickers. Check them in 5 minutes as more stock may be needed. The trick here is that once the dumplings are firm and fully cooked the stock will evaporate and the bottoms will crisp-up again.  SPICY SOY DIPPING SAUCE:  Combine all and serve in a small bowl.  Plating Serve pot stickers on a large platter lined with lettuce with a bowl of dipping sauce on the side.\n","permalink":"https://danaukes.com/recipes/pork-and-ginger-pot-stickers/","tags":null,"title":"Pork and Ginger Pot Stickers"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This recipe from a story on chili-style dishes from around the world is one of those things that people just can’t stop eating; friends have been known to have thirds and then smile with slight embarrassment and serve themselves some more. Part of its appeal is that it smells so good while it’s cooking \u0026ndash; the combination of garlic, pork, orange juice and dark beer is extremely potent. It’s good served over rice or in bowls with corn bread on the side.\nIngredients  1 cup orange juice 1 (12-ounce) bottle dark beer 1 pound tomatillos, papery husks removed, quartered 1/4 cup peanut oil 1 head garlic, peeled 2 pounds boneless pork, cut into 1/2-inch cubes Salt, pepper 2 large onions, thinly sliced 2 pounds Roma tomatoes, chopped 3 jalapeno chiles, diced 1 teaspoon crushed hot red pepper, or more to taste 1 bunch cilantro, leaves chopped 1 (1-pound) can black beans with liquid or 1 1/2 cups homemade cooked black beans with liquid Cooked rice 1* /2 avocado, peeled and sliced Cilantro sprigs Lime Sour Cream  Directions  Combine orange juice, beer and tomatillos in large saucepan. Cook over medium heat about 20 minutes. Set aside. Heat peanut oil in large skillet. Add garlic cloves and cook 2 minutes. Stir in 1/4 of cubed pork and season to taste with salt and pepper. Brown pork on all sides, remove pork with slotted spoon and add to tomatillos. Cook remaining pork in skillet. Remove pork and garlic and add to tomatillos. Add onions and lightly brown. Add to tomatillo and pork mixture. Mix in tomatoes, jalapeno chiles, crushed red pepper and cilantro. Cover and cook over low heat 2 hours. (Chili can also be cooked in 350-degree oven 2 hours.) Add beans. Cook, uncovered, 1/2 hour more. Adjust seasonings to taste. Serve over rice, garnished with sliced avocado, sprigs of cilantro and Lime Sour Cream. Makes 6 servings.

Use a mandoline slicer or the slicing attachment of a food processor to slice the potatoes uniformly thin. A pound of dried beans, rice, or coins can be substituted for the pie weights. For an alternate method for unmolding the galette, see page 31.\nDIRECTIONS  Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Place potatoes in large bowl and fill with cold water. Using hands, swirl to remove excess starch, then drain in colander. Spread potatoes onto kitchen towels and thoroughly dry. Whisk 4 tablespoons butter, cornstarch, salt, pepper, and rosemary (if using) together in large bowl. Add dried potatoes and toss until thoroughly coated. Place remaining tablespoon butter in heavy bottomed 10-inch ovenproof nonstick skillet and swirl to coat. Place 1 potato slice in center of skillet then overlap slices in circle around center slice, -followed by outer circle of overlapping slices. Gently place remaining sliced potatoes on top of first layer, arranging so they form even thickness. Place skillet over medium-high heat and cook until sizzling and potatoes around edge of skillet start to turn translucent, about 5 minutes. Spray 12-inch square of foil with nonstick cooking spray. Place foil, sprayed side down, on top of potatoes. Place 9-inch cake pan on top of foil and fill with 2 cups pie weights. Firmly press down on cake pan to compress potatoes. Transfer skillet to oven and bake 20 minutes. Remove cake pan and foil from skillet. Continue to cook until potatoes are tender when paring knife is inserted in center, 20 to 25 minutes. Return skillet to medium heat on stovetop and cook, gently shaking pan (use potholder—handle will be hot), until galette releases from sides of pan, 2 to 3 minutes. Off heat, place cutting board over skillet.

Set aside for 5 minutes, or until the mixture foams. Add the flour and butter and, using the dough hook attachment, mix on low speed until well combined. Change to medium speed and knead until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the side of the bowl, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the dough from the bowl, clean the bowl, then oil it well. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place for 50 to 55 minutes, or until the dough has doubled in size. Heat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line 2 half sheet pans with parchment paper and lightly brush with oil. Set aside. Bring the 10 cups water and the baking soda to a rolling boil in a 12-inch straight-sided saute pan or a roasting pan (something wide and shallow is best). Meanwhile, turn the dough out onto a lightly oiled work surface and divide into 8 equal pieces. Roll out each piece of dough into a 24-inch rope. Make a U-shape with the rope, and, holding the ends of the rope, cross them over each other and press onto the bottom of the U in order to form the shape of a pretzel. Place on a half sheet pan. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. One by one, place the pretzels in the boiling water for 30 seconds. Remove them from the water using a large flat spatula. Return them to the sheet pans, brush the top of each pretzel with the beaten egg yolk and water mixture, and sprinkle with pretzel salt. Bake until dark golden brown in color, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack for at least 5 minutes before serving. If you don’t have pretzel salt, coarse sea salt will do.

Let the yeast soften, about 2 minutes; stir in the brown sugar and 1 cup flour with a wooden spoon. Dice 2 tablespoons butter and soften; stir into the mix. Add the remaining 1 1/4 cups flour and the fine salt to make a sticky dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead, adding more flour if needed, until smooth but still slightly tacky, about 5 minutes. Shape into a ball, place in a lightly greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees and grease a large baking sheet. Punch the dough to deflate it, then turn out onto a lightly floured surface. (If the dough seems tight, cover and let rest until it relaxes.) Divide the dough into 6 pieces. Roll and stretch each piece with the palms of your hands into a 30-inch rope, holding the ends and slapping the middle of the rope on the counter as you stretch. Form each rope into a pretzel shape. Dissolve the baking soda in 3 cups warm water in a shallow baking dish. Gently dip each pretzel in the soda solution, then arrange on the prepared baking sheet and sprinkle with the coarse salt. Bake until golden, 10 to 12 minutes.

Because many students don\u0026rsquo;t have a spare\nNomenclature If you are installing a linux virtual machine on your windows computer, your windows computer is called the \u0026ldquo;host\u0026rdquo;, and the linux virtual machine is called the \u0026ldquo;guest\u0026rdquo;\nHost Computer Installation You will need some packages installed on the host side to communicate with your guest(virtual) machine\n Install Python, preferably via the Anaconda distribution   You\u0026rsquo;ll need some additional packages. From a command prompt:\npip install service_identity roslibpy    C/C++ Compiler (optional). Only required if you will be installing python packages on Windows that need to be compiled. Install Virtualbox. This tutorial was written for Virtualbox 6, though I don\u0026rsquo;t anticipate major functionality changes between neighboring versions. Install the latest version. Install the virtualbox extension pack as well Install Putty for networked ssh acess  Download Ubuntu You probably want Ubuntu 18.04 (LTS) desktop edition. Make sure you download an .iso file so that the virutal machine can load it.\nNote: The ROS version you want to use impacts which Ubuntu version you should select. They are paired together.\nCreating the Guest Machine The next steps outline how to go about creating a Virtual Machine similar to the one used in this tutorial.\n Create Virtual Machine  4Gb Ram 50Gb HD, flexible size option 1-2 cpus load ubuntu 18.04 iso   Install Ubuntu  minimum install no 3rd party drivers no downloads during install username: idealab pw: idealab sign in automatically   take a snapshot of the virtual machine at this point. If anything goes wrong you can go back to this point  Set up the Virtual Machine to prepare for ROS install Note: All these steps should be run within the guest.\nHint: To open up a terminal, remember the handy keyboard-based shortcut of ctrl+alt+t\n  install guest additions\n  First, run this in the terminal\nsudo apt install -y virtualbox-guest-utils virtualbox-guest-dkms   Install the virtualbox guest additions cd from the guest os window and select run when the button pops up.\n  let it run\n  eject the cd from the virtualbox host menu\n  Restart guest computer (using the guest menu in the top right corner)\n    Install other packages\n#update repository sudo apt update #visual package manager sudo apt install -y synaptic #ssh access sudo apt install -y openssh-server #python editor sudo apt install -y spyder3 #ifconfig command and other networking tools sudo apt install net-tools #misc sudo apt install -y curl #python packages sudo apt install -y python3-serial python3-pip   Take another Snapshot\n  Installing ROS Follow the detailed installation instructions at https://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu, or follow the condensed instructions in the next section.\nGuest Network Setup   Power down your guest machine from within the guest OS (top right corner of the screen)\n  Once powered down, in your host machine, change the virtualbox network settings to \u0026ldquo;bridged adapter\u0026rdquo; mode\n  Assign a custom MAC address to the guest in the advanced preferences menu. This will make your virtual machine easier to identify for further network setup\n You can use something like 000000000001 to make it easy to remember, but never use the same MAC address for multiple machines on the same network. It is supposed to be a unique identifier.    Start the guest machine again\n  Find the ip address of ethernet port in the terminal\n#sudo apt install net-tools ifconfig -v   this will return information about each networking device, that looks like this:\nenp0s3: flags=4163\u0026lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST\u0026gt; mtu 1500 inet 192.168.0.17 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.0.255 inet6 2600:8800:2281:3600:a6d7:41a9:9d6b:e48b prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x0\u0026lt;global\u0026gt; inet6 fe80::7804:5434:c83:a827 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x20\u0026lt;link\u0026gt; inet6 2600:8800:2281:3600:588c:62a0:442a:d6ce prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x0\u0026lt;global\u0026gt; ether 08:00:27:00:80:00 txqueuelen 1000 (Ethernet) RX packets 47127 bytes 47300474 (47.3 MB) RX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 frame 0 TX packets 13563 bytes 1385399 (1.3 MB) TX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 carrier 0 collisions 0 lo: flags=73\u0026lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING\u0026gt; mtu 65536 inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 255.0.0.0 inet6 ::1 prefixlen 128 scopeid 0x10\u0026lt;host\u0026gt; loop txqueuelen 1000 (Local Loopback) RX packets 117914 bytes 20197993 (20.1 MB) RX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 frame 0 TX packets 117914 bytes 20197993 (20.1 MB) TX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 carrier 0 collisions 0   The value you want is the \u0026ldquo;inet\u0026rdquo; value under, in this case, enp0s3, or 192.168.0.17 in our case. Remember this value, this is how you will communicate with your virtual pc\n  Assign a static ip address (optional) You can do this in your router or within the guest machine; this will enable you to communicate with this machine at a known address.\nOption 1: Router-specific instructions Please see the router specific instructions for reserving a specific IP address (using the guest machine\u0026rsquo;s custom MAC address) using DHCP. You must have administrator access to your router\nOption 2: Within the Guest: Open up the network configuration (top right hand corner of the screen near power) and follow the menu system to assign a custom IP4 address to your ethernet controller. You should be comfortable with networking concepts and have a firm understanding of your network topology before modifying this setting, or other computers will no longer be able to communicate with this computer.\n","permalink":"https://danaukes.com/notebook/ros/01-setup/","tags":["ros","ubuntu","linux"],"title":"Setup"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Carbide 3D Downloads grbl 1.1 - Google Search shapeoko 3 specs - Google Search Reading metric instead of inches - Shapeoko - Carbide 3D Community Site g21 vs g20 gcode - Google Search Having problem jogging my newly assembled shapeoko 3 - Page 2 - The Shapeoko Forum Page Not Found Adjusting S3 Steps and Micro Steps - Shapeoko - Carbide 3D Community Site Enable Homing in Carbide Motion - Carbide 3D Shapeoko 3 - Default GRBL Settings - Carbide 3D shapeoko3 board 2.2 - Google Search shapeoko 3 dip switch - Google Search Grbl Configuration - ShapeOko SO3 XXL homing error \u0026quot;GRBL Error: Setting Disabled\u0026quot; - Shapeoko - Carbide 3D Community Site Tool Changes - Carbide 3D amana tool 1/4 to 1/8 adapter - Google Search router 1/4 to 1/8 adapter press fit - Google Search Rockler 1/4\u0026quot; to 1/8\u0026quot; Collet Reducer | Google Shopping how to replace tool in compression collet - Google Search Stuck 1/4\u0026quot; collet adaptor | Router Forums  ","permalink":"https://danaukes.com/notebook/shapeoko/","tags":null,"title":"Shapeoko Links"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Images ","permalink":"https://danaukes.com/recipes/shaved-brussels-sprout-salad/","tags":null,"title":"Shaved Brussels Sprout Salad"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Ingredients  1 (3 1/2 to 4 pound) chicken, cut into parts (alternatively, 3 to 3 1/2 pounds of bone-in, skin-on chicken parts, such as breasts, thighs and legs) Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 1 ½ cups full-fat Greek yogurt, divided 5 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, divided 2 teaspoons ground turmeric, divided 2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed 1 tablespoon fennel seed 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 large red onion, thinly sliced, divided 2 tablespoons olive oil ½ cup mint or cilantro leaves, torn  Directions  Season chicken parts with salt and pepper.

Bake in the preheated oven on the baking tray for 25 minutes. Remove the foil. Bake for an additional 20 to 30 minutes, or until the filling is bubbling and the crust is golden. Cool on a wire rack.

Sift together flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, cocoa and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Add the hot coffee, oil and milk and mix it for about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the eggs and vanilla. Beat for 2 more minutes. This chocolate cake recipe has a very liquid batter. Pour batter in prepared cake pans and bake for approx. 30 minutes. The cake is ready when an inserted wooden skewer or cake tester comes out clean or when cake springs back when lightly pressed with a finger. Let the cake cool in pans for about 10 minutes. Loosen the sides with a knife or metal spatula and invert to a metal rack. Invert again to another rack to prevent the cake from splitting.

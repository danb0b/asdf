&lt;ul>
&lt;li>1 pound (95-percent) lean ground beef&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3/4 cup cooked quinoa (use frozen or cook it from scratch*)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/4 cup finely chopped onion&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/4 cup grated carrot&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/4 cup grated zucchini&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 tablespoons ketchup&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 clove garlic minced&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 tablespoon soy sauce&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/4 teaspoon dried thyme&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 egg lightly beaten&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Preheat the oven to 450°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper; set aside.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a large bowl, mix together all ingredients until well combined. Shape into 16 balls and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Roast until cooked through and golden brown, 15 to 17 minutes. Serve hot.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="note">Note&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To cook quinoa, bring 1 cup of water to a boil in a small pot. Pour in ½ cup quinoa, cover and simmer until water is absorbed, 10 to 12 minutes. Set aside off of the heat for 10 minutes then fluff with a fork. Makes about 1 1/2 cups. Use 3/4 cup in this recipe, and reserve the remaining for another use.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chicken Satay with Spicy Peanut Sauce</title><link>https://www.danaukes.com/recipes/chicken-satay-with-spicy-peanut-sauce/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.danaukes.com/recipes/chicken-satay-with-spicy-peanut-sauce/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Chipotle Salsa</title><link>https://www.danaukes.com/recipes/chipotle-salsa/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.danaukes.com/recipes/chipotle-salsa/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d say this makes about 1/2 gallon of salsa &amp;ndash; make sure you have Tupperware.

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>1/2 cup (125ml) water&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3 tablespoons (40g) butter, salted or unsalted, cut into cubes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/4 teaspoon salt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>big pinch of chile powder, or a few turns of freshly-ground black pepper&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 cup (70g) flour&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 large eggs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>12 chives, finely-minced (or 1 to 2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3/4 cup (about 3 ounces, 90g) grated cheese (See above for ideas)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You should have all the ingredients ready to go before you start. Don&amp;rsquo;t let the water and butter boil away while you grate the cheese. Second is to let the batter cool for a few minutes before adding the eggs so you don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;lsquo;cook&amp;rsquo; them. Make sure when you stir in the eggs that you do it vigorously. 1. Preheat the oven to 425F (220C.) Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 2. Heat the water, butter, salt, and chile in a saucepan until the butter is melted. 3. Dump in the flour all at once and stir vigorously until the mixture pulls away from the sides into a smooth ball. Remove from heat and let rest two minutes. 4. Add the eggs, one at a time, stirring quickly to make sure the eggs don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;lsquo;cook.&amp;rsquo; The batter will first appear lumpy, but it will smooth out. 5. Add about 3/4s of the grated cheese and the chives, and stir until well-mixed. 6. Scrape the mixture into a pastry bag pipe the dough into mounds, evenly-spaced apart, making each about the size of a small cherry tomato. 7. Top each puff with a bit of the remaining cheese, then pop the baking sheet in the oven. 8. Bake for 10 minutes, then turn the oven down to 375F (190C) and bake for an additional 20 to 25 minutes, until they&amp;rsquo;re completely golden brown. Serving: The puffs are best served warm, and if making them in advance, you can simply pipe the gougères on baking sheets and cook right before your guests arrive, or reheat the baked cheese puffs in a low oven for 5-10 minutes before serving. A bit of troubleshooting: The problem folks have with pâte à choux is them being deflated. The usual causes are too much liquid (eggs), or underbaking. Make sure to use large eggs, not extra-large or jumbo. And bake the puffs until they&amp;rsquo;re completely browned up the sides so they don&amp;rsquo;t sink when cooling.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kale Tarts with Fennel and Olives</title><link>https://www.danaukes.com/recipes/kale-tarts-with-fennel-and-olives/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.danaukes.com/recipes/kale-tarts-with-fennel-and-olives/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 medium yellow onion, diced (1 cup)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 medium bulb fennel, quartered, cored, and thinly sliced (3.4 cup)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3 cloves garlic, finely chopped (1 Tbsp.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 medium bunch Lacinato kale, stems removed, chopped into bite-sized pieces (6 cups)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1⁄3 cup crumbled feta cheese, plus more for topping&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1⁄4 cup kalamata olives, pitted and finely chopped&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 tbsp. coarsely chopped fresh parsley&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fresh ground black pepper&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 (17-oz.) package (2 sheets) all butter puff pastry, thawed in the fridge overnight&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3 tbsp. unsalted butter, melted&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Heat the oil is a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned, 5-7 minutes. Add fennel and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 8–10 minutes. Lower heat; add kale, cover pan and cook until kale is soft and wilted, adding a teaspoon of water if necessary, about 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat and fold in feta, olives and parsley. Season with pepper to taste.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Preheat oven to 375° and line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Lightly flour a work surface and unroll one of the pieces of puff pastry. Use a rolling pin to sheet the dough out to a 14–inch square, then cut the sheet into nine equal squares. Cut L-shaped slits on opposite corners of each square (creating a frame-like shape). Take hold of both corners and fold them toward the opposite corner, passing one point under the other and pressing them in place, to create a diamond-shaped pocket to hold the filling. Repeat the process with the second sheet of dough, then divide the pastries between the prepared baking sheets, leaving at least 1 1⁄2 inches between each pastry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mound 2 generous tablespoons of filling into each pocket; top with a little more feta and a drizzle of olive oil. Brush the outer edges with melted butter, then transfer to the oven and bake until evenly golden brown and puffed, 25–30 minutes. Serve warm, topped with more feta if you like.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>2 cups chopped napa cabbage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 tablespoon salt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 pound ground pork (Don&amp;rsquo;t get lean pork, the fat is good for juicy and flavorful dumplings)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 tablespoons minced ginger&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 tablespoons thin soy sauce&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3 tablespoons sesame oil&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>4 cups all-purpose flour&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>1/3 cup thin soy sauce&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/3 cup rice wine vinegar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/3 cup sliced scallions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 teaspoon sesame oil&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 tablespoon sambal&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Sprinkle cabbage with the 1/2 tablespoon of salt and let stand for 30 minutes. Place the cabbage on a clean dishtowel or cheesecloth and squeeze out any water. The dryer the cabbage the better. In a large bowl thoroughly mix the cabbage with all of the other ingredients, except the chicken stock. Cook a tester to check the seasoning.;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="hot-water-dough-1">Hot Water Dough&lt;/h3>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>In a stainless steel bowl mix flour and salt. Slowly add hot water to flour in 1/4 cup increments. Mix with chopsticks until a ball is formed and the dough is not too hot to handle. On a floured surface, knead dough until it becomes a smooth, elastic ball. Place back in bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rest for at least 1 hour. Working on a floured surface with floured hands, roll out dough to form a long &amp;rsquo;noodle&amp;rsquo;, 1-inch in diameter. Cut 1/2-inch pieces and turn them over so the cut sides are facing up. Flatten with your palm and roll out thin using a rolling pin. The dumpling wrapper should end up about 3 inches in diameter.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="making-the-dumplings">MAKING THE DUMPLINGS:&lt;/h3>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Place a small mound of filling in the middle of the wrapper. (Be very careful not to touch the edges with the filling as this will impede proper sealing of the dumplings. Nothing is worse than dumplings breaking during cooking.) Fold the wrapper in half to form a half moon shape. Starting on one end fold/pinch the wrapper tightly together. Proceed with this fold/pinch method until the dumpling is completely sealed. There will be approximately 10 to 14 folds per dumpling. Rest the dumplings with the folded edges straight up.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;li>In a hot saute pan coated well with oil, place pot stickers flat side down and cook until the bottom is browned. Have pan cover ready and add 1 cup of chicken stock, cover immediately. Be careful, the liquid will splatter! The stock will steam the pot stickers. Check them in 5 minutes as more stock may be needed. The trick here is that once the dumplings are firm and fully cooked the stock will evaporate and the bottoms will crisp-up again.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>1 1/2 cups warm water (110-115 degrees F)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 tablespoon sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 teaspoons kosher salt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 envelope active dry yeast&lt;/li>
&lt;li>22 ounces all-purpose flour&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 ounces unsalted butter (melted)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vegetable oil (for the bowl and pan)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>10 cups water&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2/3 cup baking soda&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 large egg yolk (beaten with 1 tablespoon water)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pretzel salt&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Combine the 1 1/2 cups warm water, the sugar and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle the yeast on top. Set aside for 5 minutes, or until the mixture foams.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the flour and butter and, using the dough hook attachment, mix on low speed until well combined. Change to medium speed and knead until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the side of the bowl, 4 to 5 minutes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remove the dough from the bowl, clean the bowl, then oil it well. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place for 50 to 55 minutes, or until the dough has doubled in size.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Heat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line 2 half sheet pans with parchment paper and lightly brush with oil. Set aside.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bring the 10 cups water and the baking soda to a rolling boil in a 12-inch straight-sided saute pan or a roasting pan (something wide and shallow is best).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meanwhile, turn the dough out onto a lightly oiled work surface and divide into 8 equal pieces. Roll out each piece of dough into a 24-inch rope. Make a U-shape with the rope, and, holding the ends of the rope, cross them over each other and press onto the bottom of the U in order to form the shape of a pretzel. Place on a half sheet pan. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One by one, place the pretzels in the boiling water for 30 seconds. Remove them from the water using a large flat spatula. Return them to the sheet pans, brush the top of each pretzel with the beaten egg yolk and water mixture, and sprinkle with pretzel salt.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bake until dark golden brown in color, 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack for at least 5 minutes before serving.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you don’t have pretzel salt, coarse sea salt will do.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>1 cup milk&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 package active dry yeast&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3 tablespoons packed light brown sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading&lt;/li>
&lt;li>10 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for greasing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 teaspoon fine salt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/3 cup baking soda&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 tablespoons coarse salt&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Warm the milk in a saucepan until it&amp;rsquo;s about 110 degrees; pour into a medium bowl and sprinkle in the yeast. Let the yeast soften, about 2 minutes; stir in the brown sugar and 1 cup flour with a wooden spoon. Dice 2 tablespoons butter and soften; stir into the mix. Add the remaining 1 1/4 cups flour and the fine salt to make a sticky dough. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead, adding more flour if needed, until smooth but still slightly tacky, about 5 minutes. Shape into a ball, place in a lightly greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 1 hour.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees and grease a large baking sheet. Punch the dough to deflate it, then turn out onto a lightly floured surface. (If the dough seems tight, cover and let rest until it relaxes.) Divide the dough into 6 pieces. Roll and stretch each piece with the palms of your hands into a 30-inch rope, holding the ends and slapping the middle of the rope on the counter as you stretch. Form each rope into a pretzel shape.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dissolve the baking soda in 3 cups warm water in a shallow baking dish. Gently dip each pretzel in the soda solution, then arrange on the prepared baking sheet and sprinkle with the coarse salt. Bake until golden, 10 to 12 minutes.&lt;/li>

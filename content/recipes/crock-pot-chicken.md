## Ingredients

- 1.5 teaspoons salt
- 2 teaspoons paprika 
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 
- 1 teaspoon onion powder 
- 1 teaspoon thyme 
- 1 teaspoon white pepper 
- 1⁄2 teaspoon garlic powder 
- 1⁄2 teaspoon black pepper 
- 1 large roasting chicken (with pop-up timer if possible) 
- 1 cup chopped onion (optional) 

## Directions

1. In a small bowl, combine the spices.
2. Remove any giblets from chicken and clean chicken.
3. Rub spice mixture onto the chicken.
4. Place in resealable plastic bag and refrigerate overnight. (I usually skip this step because I'm always in a hurry).
5. When ready to cook, put chopped onion in bottom of crock pot.
6. Add chicken. No liquid is needed, the chicken will make its own juices.
7. Cook on low 4-8 hours.

> Note: I highly recommend a pop-up timer in the chicken because some crock pots cook faster/slower than others (my crock pot cooks this recipe in 4-5 hours).

* 1/2 cup quinoa rinsed and drained
* 3-4 tbsp low-sodium vegetable broth (to saute)
* 1 medium yellow onion diced
* 4 medium garlic cloves minced
* 2 tbsp tomato paste
* 1 1/2 tbsp Italian seasonings
* 1/2 tsp salt (add more to taste)
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* 28 oz can diced fire-roasted tomatoes
* 3 medium bell peppers seeded and diced
* 14 oz can green lentils rinsed and drained (about 2 cups cooked)
* 1 tbsp maple syrup
* 4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth
* 10 oz bag frozen spinach

## Instructions

1. First, cook the quinoa in a separate medium-sized pot according to the package instructions. When the quinoa is done cooking, take it off the heat and set it aside for later.
1. In a large dutch oven over medium heat, saute the diced onion in 3-4 tbsp of vegetable broth until it's soft and translucent.
1. Add minced garlic, 2 tbsp tomato paste, 1 ½ tbsp Italian seasonings, ½ tsp salt, and ½ tsp black pepper to the pot. Stir to combine and let it cook for a few minutes to toast the spices.
1. Next, add the fire-roasted diced tomatoes (with the juice), diced bell peppers, green lentils, 1 tbsp maple syrup, and 4 cups of vegetable broth to the pot. Stir to combine and increase the heat to bring it to a low simmer. Reduce the heat to medium, and then let the soup cook for 25 minutes. 
1. Lastly, add the frozen spinach and the cooked quinoa and let it cook for 5 more minutes or until the spinach is warmed through. 

## Notes

* Cook the quinoa in a separate pot and only add it to the soup right before you serve it. If you cook the quinoa in the soup, it will absorb most of the broth and the texture will be more like a stew.
* Don't drain the juice from the can of fire-roasted tomatoes, it adds a lot of smoky flavor to the broth.
* Add the spinach at the end so it only cooks for about 5 minutes. By doing this, the spinach will retain its bright green color and make a prettier presentation. 
* Store the leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for 4-5 days or you can freeze it for a future meal.

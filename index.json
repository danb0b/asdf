It is a way to have vast, disparate sources of data come together in networked way in order to perform tasks important to robotics, such as simulation, sensing, control, learning, and teleoperation. It coordinates the transfer of information from one place to another in a way that is scalable\nIntegration The IDEAlab has a number of disparate pieces of hardware, each of which is controlled using a mix of standardized and proprietary protocols. It is important to be able to access that data in a standardized way so that we can run experiments more efficiently\nEach device typically has an API or protocol that we can use to communicate with it, but these protocols are not standardized (nor should they be). In the past, when creating experimental data collection setups, we would write individual Matlab or Python-based scripts to communicate with the specific devices we needed. This led to non-standardized code with situation-specific instructions making it difficult to reuse the code for new purposes, limiting sharing. Secondly, as multiple devices were often integrated together within some sort of while loop, communication from multiple sources at different rates led to common problems with buffering and asynchronous communication, leading to poor performance. Through ROS, we have more control over each devices communication rate in a way that is non-blocking and variable depending on need.\nHigh Level Overview There are a variety of terms used for the parts of ROS, and while there are good tutorials out there, it is nice to see a quick summary of terms in one place.\nItem Description Master the computer that coordinates communication sent over ROS Node A node is a program compiled to interact with ros topics. Nodes can be run on different PC\u0026rsquo;s and communicate over communication layer Service Like a node, except that services respond to requests rather than publish at their own discretion Message particular data type that gets passed between nodes Topic A category of messages that a node can subscribe to Package collections of nodes, messages, and data types that work together as a project. They are written in python and/or C++ launch file a method for starting up a number of ros nodes, services and topics. synchronizes the startup of ros stuff publish how to send data over ROS subscribe how to select and receive data published over ROS Devices Some examples of the types of devices we need to communicate with include:\nEthernet-based data from standalone robotic systems UR-5 and UR-5e Wifi-based microcontrollers suh as the Photon. ATI LAN-based sensors Camera data from USB webcams or ethernet-accessible computers like the Raspberry Pi. Ethernet-based motion tracking systems like Optitrack. USB-based devices connected to a local or remote computer Novint Falcon Thorlabs Linear Stage Serial over USB data to/from microcontrollers connected to a computer, for custom sensing Accelerometer Data from I2C based chips Current data from current sensing chips Analog data from I/O pins Dynamixel Servos Load Cells PCI-card-based devices with drivers available only in Windows, like NI hardware etc\u0026hellip; The variety of these devices, their connection to a computer, and their specific constraints, is the reason we have chosen ROS for our integration effort. We have determined that ROS can satisfy those needs while remaining relatively accessible to students in terms of the learning curve and complexity.\nROS Capabilities ROS is capable of performing a number of tasks critical for robotics research\nData Collection Once routed into ROS, it is important to select which pieces of data to gather, process and publish. Our needs at this point are mostly related to collection, processing, filtering, and recording that data. Future work will relate to closing the loop with control.\nData Processing Data can be processed within the ROS environment. One standard way to do that would be to have a separate node \u0026ndash; a program that runs within its own process \u0026ndash; subscribing to a stream of data, doing something with it, and then publishing a derivative of that work. Examples include\ntaking camera data from two cameras and to combine it into a 3d image. filtering noisy sensor data compressing an image extracting raw load cell data and converting it into a resultant force and location. Recording Data can also be recorded using ROS, by subscribing to different topics and logging everything as it comes in into a \u0026ldquo;bag\u0026rdquo; file. This functionality also permits replaying the same data as it came in, for subsequent processing later\nViewing and Interacting ROS also has the capability to view and interact with different kinds of data\ntext data can be printed to a terminal or viewed in a GUI image data can be subscribed to and viewed using a native viewer Custom nodes can be composed in Python or C++ that permit one to display and control pieces of data from one interface. Versions This tutorial is set up assuming Ubuntu 18 and ROS Melodic. Things will change, but for ROS 1 and Ubuntu, this can serve as a rough roadmap even in other versions. Some instructions may change over time and this will be updated to reflect that as needed.\n","permalink":"https://danaukes.com/notebook/ros/00-overview/","tags":["ros","ubuntu","linux"],"title":"Overview"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Create a new SSH key Use a key like \u0026ldquo;ed25519\u0026rdquo;\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 print the public key:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub add your key(s) to authorized keys:\nedit:\nsudo nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys or copy directly:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub \u0026gt;\u0026gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Default Permissions chmod 700 ~/.ssh # the .ssh directory itself chmod 600 ~/.ssh/* # by default all the files in .ssh chmod 644 ~/.ssh/*.pub # change public key permissions Other Helpful Stuff list all keys ssh-add -l remove all keys ssh-add -D add passphrase ssh-keygen -p -f \u0026lt;path-to-key\u0026gt; create cert/key from here:\nopenssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem\nReferences https://linuxnatives.net/2019/how-to-create-good-ssh-keys https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ssh-essentials-working-with-ssh-servers-clients-and-keys https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys-on-ubuntu-20-04 https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-ssh-key-based-authentication-on-a-linux-server https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys ","permalink":"https://danaukes.com/notebook/ssh/ssh-reference/","tags":["ubuntu","linux","ssh","encryption","keys"],"title":"SSH General Reference"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Install and Setup Install gnupg, nautilus integration (seahorse), and restart nautilus\nsudo apt install -y gnupg sudo apt install -y seahorse seahorse-nautilus killall nautilus Import Keys\nConfiguration files can include sensitive information such as passwords, contact information, or other personal information you don\u0026rsquo;t wish to share, even though you may wish to store it in the cloud for easy retrieval.

Because many students don\u0026rsquo;t have a spare computer they can load Ubuntu on, a virtual machine often makes sense. The most recent versions of virtualbox are quite adept and providing full support to usb devices piped in through a windows host, making this a nice, general solution for developing ROS environments.\nNomenclature If you are installing a linux virtual machine on your windows computer, your windows computer is called the \u0026ldquo;host\u0026rdquo;, and the linux virtual machine is called the \u0026ldquo;guest\u0026rdquo;\nHost Computer Installation You will need some packages installed on the host side to communicate with your guest(virtual) machine\nInstall Python, preferably via the Anaconda distribution You\u0026rsquo;ll need some additional packages. From a command prompt:\npip install service_identity roslibpy C/C++ Compiler (optional). Only required if you will be installing python packages on Windows that need to be compiled. Install Virtualbox. This tutorial was written for Virtualbox 6, though I don\u0026rsquo;t anticipate major functionality changes between neighboring versions. Install the latest version. Install the virtualbox extension pack as well Install Putty for networked ssh acess Download Ubuntu You probably want Ubuntu 18.04 (LTS) desktop edition. Make sure you download an .iso file so that the virutal machine can load it.\nNote: The ROS version you want to use impacts which Ubuntu version you should select. They are paired together.\nCreating the Guest Machine The next steps outline how to go about creating a Virtual Machine similar to the one used in this tutorial.\nCreate Virtual Machine 4Gb Ram 50Gb HD, flexible size option 1-2 cpus load ubuntu 18.04 iso Install Ubuntu minimum install no 3rd party drivers no downloads during install username: idealab pw: idealab sign in automatically take a snapshot of the virtual machine at this point. If anything goes wrong you can go back to this point Set up the Virtual Machine to prepare for ROS install Note: All these steps should be run within the guest.\nHint: To open up a terminal, remember the handy keyboard-based shortcut of ctrl+alt+t\ninstall guest additions\nFirst, run this in the terminal\nsudo apt install -y virtualbox-guest-utils virtualbox-guest-dkms Install the virtualbox guest additions cd from the guest os window and select run when the button pops up.\nlet it run\neject the cd from the virtualbox host menu\nRestart guest computer (using the guest menu in the top right corner)\nInstall other packages. See Ros Prerequisites\nTake another Snapshot\nInstalling ROS Follow the detailed installation instructions at https://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu, or follow the condensed instructions in the next section.\nGuest Network Setup Power down your guest machine from within the guest OS (top right corner of the screen)\nOnce powered down, in your host machine, change the virtualbox network settings to \u0026ldquo;bridged adapter\u0026rdquo; mode\nAssign a custom MAC address to the guest in the advanced preferences menu. This will make your virtual machine easier to identify for further network setup\nYou can use something like 000000000001 to make it easy to remember, but never use the same MAC address for multiple machines on the same network. It is supposed to be a unique identifier. Start the guest machine again\nFind the ip address of ethernet port in the terminal\n#sudo apt install net-tools ifconfig -v this will return information about each networking device, that looks like this:\nenp0s3: flags=4163\u0026lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST\u0026gt; mtu 1500 inet 192.168.0.17 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.0.255 inet6 2600:8800:2281:3600:a6d7:41a9:9d6b:e48b prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x0\u0026lt;global\u0026gt; inet6 fe80::7804:5434:c83:a827 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x20\u0026lt;link\u0026gt; inet6 2600:8800:2281:3600:588c:62a0:442a:d6ce prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x0\u0026lt;global\u0026gt; ether 08:00:27:00:80:00 txqueuelen 1000 (Ethernet) RX packets 47127 bytes 47300474 (47.3 MB) RX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 frame 0 TX packets 13563 bytes 1385399 (1.3 MB) TX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 carrier 0 collisions 0 lo: flags=73\u0026lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING\u0026gt; mtu 65536 inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 255.0.0.0 inet6 ::1 prefixlen 128 scopeid 0x10\u0026lt;host\u0026gt; loop txqueuelen 1000 (Local Loopback) RX packets 117914 bytes 20197993 (20.1 MB) RX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 frame 0 TX packets 117914 bytes 20197993 (20.1 MB) TX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 carrier 0 collisions 0 The value you want is the \u0026ldquo;inet\u0026rdquo; value under, in this case, enp0s3, or 192.168.0.17 in our case. Remember this value, this is how you will communicate with your virtual pc\nAssign a static ip address (optional) You can do this in your router or within the guest machine; this will enable you to communicate with this machine at a known address.\nOption 1: Router-specific instructions Please see the router specific instructions for reserving a specific IP address (using the guest machine\u0026rsquo;s custom MAC address) using DHCP. You must have administrator access to your router\nOption 2: Within the Guest: Open up the network configuration (top right hand corner of the screen near power) and follow the menu system to assign a custom IP4 address to your ethernet controller. You should be comfortable with networking concepts and have a firm understanding of your network topology before modifying this setting, or other computers will no longer be able to communicate with this computer.\n","permalink":"https://danaukes.com/notebook/ros/01-virtualbox-setup/","tags":["ros","ubuntu","linux","virtualbox"],"title":"Virtualbox Setup (optional)"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Introduction Dconf is where many keyboard shortcuts and user preferences exist.

Upon installing Ubuntu 20.04, initially the keyboard worked but other aspects of the computer did not, such as being able to control screen brightness, fan speed, etc. After the kernel was automatically updated, however, suddently I was unable to use the keyboard, but intermittently. Each reboot might allow me or not. To add an additional wrinkle, I had also encrypted my hard drive using LUKS, meaning that if I was traveling or did not have access to an external keyboard, I would be locked out.\nInstall a compatible Kernel. The first thing I did was to manually install a kernel I could at least unlock my computer with. I followed the instructions here to get the linux 5.8.18 kernel installed.\nList all kernels:\ndpkg --list | grep linux-image Recompile your Kernel The real solution, however, is discussed in this chain of emails, and the solution is discussed here.\nopen software-properties-gtk and enable source code\nFollow instructions to build your own kernel\nget dependencies\nget source ()\napt-get source linux-image-unsigned-$(uname -r) update configs\nchmod a+x debian/rules chmod a+x debian/scripts/* chmod a+x debian/scripts/misc/* LANG=C fakeroot debian/rules clean LANG=C fakeroot debian/rules editconfigs # you need to go through each (Y, Exit, Y, Exit..) or get a complaint about config late Use the advice from here, update yoru configuration (don\u0026rsquo;t uncheck \u0026ldquo;support for uevent\u0026rdquo;)\nASUS UM425UA internal keyboard doesn\u0026#39;t work on a \u0026#34;cold boot\u0026#34; (first power-on). It activates only after restart. I noticed it when tried to boot live image of Ubuntu 20.04.3 This problem probably appeared with kernel version 5.9 or 5.10 because with Ubuntu 20.04.2 live image (Linux 5.8) keyboard loads fine. Tried kernel 5.14 and it\u0026#39;s still affected. I tried to recompile kernels 5.11 \u0026amp; 5.13 with SERIO_I8042 set as a module (as suggested in an Arch Linux bug report) and keyboard now works from the first start. In \u0026#34;make config\u0026#34; the changes are: Device Drivers -\u0026gt; \u0026gt; Generic Driver Options -\u0026gt; [ ] Support for uevent #may slowdown boot, needed only for U14.04 \u0026gt; Input device support \u0026gt; Keyboards -\u0026gt; [M] AT keyboard \u0026gt; Hardware I/O ports -\u0026gt; [M] i8042 PC Keyboard controller It changed such lines in config: CONFIG_KEYBOARD_ATKBD=m CONFIG_SERIO_I8042=m CONFIG_SERIO_LIBPS2=m References: https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/70384 https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2459149 https://linux.org/threads/asus-zenbook-14-um425ua-keyboard-not-respond-during-cold-boot.33738/#post-133830 P.S. Other option which helped me was a GRUB parameter \u0026#34;i8042.reset=1\u0026#34; but it had a positive effect only with kernel 5.11 These changes break the rules. Modify\nnano debian.master/config/annotations search for \u0026ldquo;CONFIG_KEYBOARD_ATKBD\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;CONFIG_SERIO_I8042\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;CONFIG_SERIO_LIBPS2\u0026rdquo; and set amd64 option to \u0026ldquo;m\u0026rdquo; for each. Update version number so that the apt repository doesn\u0026rsquo;t supersede it on the next upgrade (according to the ubuntu guide)\nadd a local version modifier like \u0026ldquo;+test1\u0026rdquo; to the end of the first version number in the debian.master/changelog file before building. This will help identify your kernel when running as it also appears in uname -a.

Add any number of = or - below the text for heading 1 or heading 2.\nHeading 1 = Heading 2 - Now, let\u0026rsquo;s see how it looks on GitHub.\nHeading 1 Heading 2 Text styles Using markdown syntax, we can change texts\u0026rsquo; styles, including bold, italic, blockquotes, monospaced, underlined, strike-through, boxed, subscript, and superscript.\nWe can use two asterisks (**), underscores (__), or an HTML tag \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt; to make a text bold. To make text italic, we can use one asterisk (*), underscore (_), or an HTML tag \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;.

When a new class is created, an object of type `Class` is initialized and assigned to a global constant (Mobile in this case). As you can see the word Class is highlighted.\nCode Highlighting We can also use triple backticks ``` before and after the code block to create the following view.\n``` public static String monthNames[] = {\u0026quot;January\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;February\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;March\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;April\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;May\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;June\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;July\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;August\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;September\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;October\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;November\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;December\u0026quot;};``` Code Highlighting We can add an optional language identifier to enable syntax highlighting.

For center-align text, use a colon on both sides of dashes. For right-align text, use a colon to the right of dashes.

The tender texture, fun factor and comforting flavors of these healthy bites is not.\nIngredients 1 Tablespoon Butter 1 cup Finely Chopped Yellow Onion 2 cups Finely Chopped Green Swiss Chard Or Spinach Leaves (not Packed) 4 cups Finely Chopped Green Or Black Kale Leaves (not Packed) ½ teaspoons Fine Sea Salt Granules 4 whole Scallions (white And Light Green Parts), Minced ½ cups Panko Dry Bread Crumbs ½ cups Finely Grated Parmesan Cheese (plus An Extra 1 To 2 Tablespoons, For Baking) ¼ teaspoons Grated Nutmeg 2 Tablespoons Prepared Green Pesto (homemade Or Store Bought) ¾ teaspoons Ground White Pepper 2 whole Large Eggs 1 whole Lemon, Cut Into Wedges (optional, For Serving) Directions Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat, then add onions and cook until just softened but not brown, about 10 minutes. Add greens and half of the salt and continue to cook and stir until completely wilted, another 10 minutes, keeping heat low enough so onions do not brown. Remove from heat and cool for 5 minutes. Stir in scallions, panko, Parmesan, nutmeg, and pesto. Taste mixture (before adding eggs) and season, starting with ¼ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper and adjusting to taste (I used ¾ teaspoon pepper and the flavor was quite prominent, if you’re into lots of pepper). Stir in eggs, breaking up yolks and combining completely into a uniform mixture. Heat oven to 375 F (if baking immediately) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll the mixture into balls of 1½ tablespoons each and place on baking sheet. Sprinkle the top of each ball with a pinch of grated Parmesan. To bake immediately: Bake about 20 minutes in the upper third of the oven, until completely cooked through (no liquid egg inside) and browned on the bottom. When done, the puffs will spring back when squeezed lightly. To freeze: Place the un-baked tray of balls in the freezer, covered loosely with plastic wrap, until balls are frozen through, about 2 hours. Remove balls from sheet and store in a freezer bag or another airtight, freezer safe container. To bake, follow directions above. Thawing not necessary—just add 5 minutes to the cook time above (25 minutes total). Notes: Makes 20 puffs, about 4 to 6 appetizer servings. I think these would be a really fun brunch appetizer! In testing, I used Swiss chard and green kale (the fluffy, curly one). If substituting other varieties of greens, use something mild and tender in place of the chard or spinach, and something sturdy, and possibly slightly bitter, in place of the kale. Refrigerating the mixture (right in the pan; for 15 to 30 minutes) before forming balls helps it to firm up, making it even easier to handle. I tried it warm and refrigerated, without issues either way. If making for a strict vegetarian, make sure the pesto and Parmesan do not contain animal rennet. Varieties that work will likely be labeled “vegetarian”.

But Henry Petroski says we must look beyond design for causes and corrections. Known for his masterly explanations of engineering successes and failures, Petroski here takes his analysis a step further, to consider the larger context in which accidents occur.\nIn To Forgive Design he surveys some of the most infamous failures of our time, from the 2007 Minneapolis bridge collapse and the toppling of a massive Shanghai apartment building in 2009 to Boston\u0026rsquo;s prolonged Big Dig and the 2010 Gulf oil spill. These avoidable disasters reveal the interdependency of people and machines within systems whose complex behavior was undreamt of by their designers, until it was too late. Petroski shows that even the simplest technology is embedded in cultural and socioeconomic constraints, complications, and contradictions.\nFailure to imagine the possibility of failure is the most profound mistake engineers can make. Software developers realized this early on and looked outside their young field, to structural engineering, as they sought a historical perspective to help them identify their own potential mistakes. By explaining the interconnectedness of technology and culture and the dangers that can emerge from complexity, Petroski demonstrates that we would all do well to follow their lead.\nThe Logic Of Failure: Recognizing And Avoiding Error In Complex Situations Dietrich Dorner link\nWhy do we make mistakes? Are there certain errors common to failure, whether in a complex enterprise or daily life? In this truly indispensable book, Dietrich Dörner identifies what he calls the “logic of failure”—certain tendencies in our patterns of thought that, while appropriate to an older, simpler world, prove disastrous for the complex world we live in now. Working with imaginative and often hilarious computer simulations, he analyzes the roots of catastrophe, showing city planners in the very act of creating gridlock and disaster, or public health authorities setting the scene for starvation. The Logic of Failure is a compass for intelligent planning and decision-making that can sharpen the skills of managers, policymakers and everyone involved in the daily challenge of getting from point A to point B.\nDrift into Failure Sidney Dekker\nlink\nWhat does the collapse of sub-prime lending have in common with a broken jackscrew in an airliner’s tailplane? Or the oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico with the burn-up of Space Shuttle Columbia? These were systems that drifted into failure. While pursuing success in a dynamic, complex environment with limited resources and multiple goal conflicts, a succession of small, everyday decisions eventually produced breakdowns on a massive scale. We have trouble grasping the complexity and normality that gives rise to such large events. We hunt for broken parts, fixable properties, people we can hold accountable. Our analyses of complex system breakdowns remain depressingly linear, depressingly componential - imprisoned in the space of ideas once defined by Newton and Descartes. The growth of complexity in society has outpaced our understanding of how complex systems work and fail. Our technologies have gotten ahead of our theories. We are able to build things - deep-sea oil rigs, jackscrews, collateralized debt obligations - whose properties we understand in isolation. But in competitive, regulated societies, their connections proliferate, their interactions and interdependencies multiply, their complexities mushroom. This book explores complexity theory and systems thinking to understand better how complex systems drift into failure. It studies sensitive dependence on initial conditions, unruly technology, tipping points, diversity - and finds that failure emerges opportunistically, non-randomly, from the very webs of relationships that breed success and that are supposed to protect organizations from disaster. It develops a vocabulary that allows us to harness complexity and find new ways of managing drift.\nFailure Modes to Failure Codes John Reeve\nlink\nAs an improvement initiative, chronic failure analysis may be the most significant benefit yet to be realized by the world of asset management. When stakeholders talk about the accuracy of their CMMS, they are really referring to the absence of good failure data. Consequently, when management requests any type of failure analysis, they are usually thinking of a verbal exercise and talking to people. They think this way because the work order only has text fields describing the problem and remedy. Without actionable data, there is no way to identify worst offenders in Pareto format. Failure Modes to Failure Codes explains exactly how to start capturing a true failure mode in support of RCM. All that\u0026rsquo;s required is the knowledge to configure the CMMS product.\nKey points:\nIf reliability centered maintenance is your goal, failure mode should be your centerpiece as this is the language of RCM. The asset offender report (failure analytic), once implemented, provides the reliability team the ability to identify worst offenders in multiple ways. And never \u0026gt; assume this type of report will exist out of the (CMMS) box. As an improvement initiative, chronic failure analysis offers the largest potential benefit in support of return on asset (ROA). Specific Failures Failure to Learn: The BP Texas City Refinery Disaster\nAndrew Hopkins\nlink\nIn Failure to Learn: The BP Texas City Refinery Disaster, respected OHS expert Professor Andrew Hopkins discusses the causes of a major explosion at the Texas City Oil Refinery on March 23, 2005, that killed 15 workers and injured more than 170 others. Failure to Learn also analyses the similarities between this event and the Longford Gas Plant explosion in Victoria in 1998, featured in his earlier book Lessons from Longford. Professor Andrew Hopkins is being recognized by the European Process Safety Centre in October 2008, in recognition of his contribution to safety. Professor Hopkins is the first winner to receive the award, outside of Europe, which is a demonstration of the impact of his valuable work worldwide. Andrew has been awarded a prize by the European Process Safety Centre for \u0026ldquo;extraordinary contribution to process safety\u0026rdquo;, the first time this has been awarded outside of Europe. He also appears in the US Chemical Safety Board film on Texas City and has been invited to appear in a subsequent film. Professor Hopkins poses questions such as: Why was the number of victims so large? Who was blamed for the explosion? What were the real causes? Had lessons been learnt from the earlier incident at Longford? Has anything changed as a result of the Texas City accident? The foreword for the book was written by Carolyn Merritt, chair of the CSB at the time of the accident and subsequent inquiry.\nSpace Systems Failures: Disasters and Rescues of Satellites, Rocket and Space Probes David M. Harland, Ralph Lorenz\nlink\nThe very first book on space systems failures written from an engineering perspective. Focuses on the causes of the failures and discusses how the engineering knowledge base has been enhanced by the lessons learned.\nDiscusses non-fatal anomalies which do not affect the ultimate success of a mission, but which are failures nevertheless.\nDescribes engineering aspects of the spacecraft, making this a valuable complementary reference work to conventional engineering texts.\nWorkplace Fatalities: Failure to Predict: A New Safety Discussion on Fatality and Serious Event Reduction Todd E. Conklin, PhD\nlink\nMany organizations tell us that work has never been as safe as it is today. They will show the lowest injury figures ever, and the rosiest incident counts in years. They want to be proud of these accomplishments, and perhaps they should be. But behind these results hides complexity and contradiction—a messiness that Todd Conklin takes us into with this book. For one, it is pretty obvious by now that trying to lower our incident and injury rates leaves the risk of process safety disasters and fatalities pretty much unaffected. Getting better at managing injuries and incidents doesn’t help us prevent fatalities and accidents—we’ve known that for a long time (Salminen, Saari, Saarela, \u0026amp; Rasanen, 1992). The number of fatalities in, say, construction, or the energy industry, has remained relatively stable over the past decades (Amalberti, 2013; National-Safety-Council, 2004), even when many organizations proudly report entire years (or more) without injury. Lowering the injury or non- serious incident rate can actually put an organization at greater risk of accidents and fatalities. In shipping, for example, injury counts were halved over a recent decade, but the number of shipping accidents tripled (Storkersen, Antonsen, \u0026amp; Kongsvik, 2016). In construction, most workers lost their lives precisely in the years with the lowest injury counts (Saloniemi \u0026amp; Oksanen, 1998). And in aviation, airlines with the fewest incidents have the highest passenger mortality risk (Barnett \u0026amp; Wang, 2000). What lies behind these fatalities? Do they really happen because some people don’t wear their personal protective equipment; that some don’t wear gloves when rules say they should? WorkPlace Fatalities: Failure to Predict is the first book for the industry professional that speaks directly to this important challenge: If your organization is so safe - Why do we have fatal and serious events?\nIterate: Ten Lessons in Design and Failure John Sharp, Colleen Macklin\nlink\nHow to confront, embrace, and learn from the unavoidable failures of creative practice; with case studies that range from winemaking to animation.\nFailure is an inevitable part of any creative practice. As game designers, John Sharp and Colleen Macklin have grappled with crises of creativity, false starts, and bad outcomes. Their tool for coping with the many varieties of failure: iteration, the cyclical process of conceptualizing, prototyping, testing, and evaluating. Sharp and Macklin have found that failure―often hidden, covered up, a source of embarrassment―is the secret ingredient of iterative creative process. In Iterate, they explain how to fail better.\nAfter laying out the four components of creative practice―intention, outcome, process, and evaluation―Sharp and Macklin describe iterative methods from a wide variety of fields. They show, for example, how Radiolab cohosts Jad Abumrad and Robert Krulwich experiment with radio as a storytelling medium; how professional skateboarder Amelia Bródka develops skateboarding tricks through trial and error; and how artistic polymath Miranda July explores human frailty through a variety of media and techniques. Whimsical illustrations tell parallel stories of iteration, as hard-working cartoon figures bake cupcakes, experiment with levitating office chairs, and think outside the box in toothbrush design (“let\u0026rsquo;s add propellers!”). All, in their various ways, use iteration to transform failure into creative outcomes. With Iterate, Sharp and Macklin offer useful lessons for anyone interested in the creative process.\nCase Studies: Allison Tauziet, winemaker; Matthew Maloney, animator; Jad Abumrad and Robert Krulwich, Radiolab cohosts; Wylie Dufresne, chef; Nathalie Pozzi, architect, and Eric Zimmerman, game designer; Andy Milne, jazz musician; Amelia Bródka, skateboarder; Baratunde Thurston, comedian; Cas Holman, toy designer; Miranda July, writer and filmmaker\nThe Failure of Risk Management: Why It\u0026rsquo;s Broken and How to Fix It Douglas W. Hubbard\nlink\nAn essential guide to the calibrated risk analysis approach The Failure of Risk Management takes a close look at misused and misapplied basic analysis methods and shows how some of the most popular \u0026ldquo;risk management\u0026rdquo; methods are no better than astrology! Using examples from the 2008 credit crisis, natural disasters, outsourcing to China, engineering disasters, and more, Hubbard reveals critical flaws in risk management methods–and shows how all of these problems can be fixed. The solutions involve combinations of scientifically proven and frequently used methods from nuclear power, exploratory oil, and other areas of business and government. Finally, Hubbard explains how new forms of collaboration across all industries and government can improve risk management in every field.\nDouglas W. Hubbard (Glen Ellyn, IL) is the inventor of Applied Information Economics (AIE) and the author of Wiley\u0026rsquo;s How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of Intangibles in Business (978-0-470-11012-6), the #1 bestseller in business math on Amazon. He has applied innovative risk assessment and risk management methods in government and corporations since 1994.\n\u0026ldquo;Doug Hubbard, a recognized expert among experts in the field of risk management, covers the entire spectrum of risk management in this invaluable guide. There are specific value-added take aways in each chapter that are sure to enrich all readers including IT, business management, students, and academics alike\u0026rdquo; —Peter Julian, former chief-information officer of the New York Metro Transit Authority. President of Alliance Group consulting\n\u0026ldquo;In his trademark style, Doug asks the tough questions on risk management. A must-read not only for analysts, but also for the executive who is making critical business decisions.\u0026rdquo; —Jim Franklin, VP Enterprise Performance Management and General Manager, Crystal Ball Global Business Unit, Oracle Corporation.\nRun to Failure: BP and the Making of the Deepwater Horizon Disaster Abrahm Lustgarten\nlink\nIt was Big Oil\u0026rsquo;s nightmare moment, and the dominoes began falling years before the well was drilled.\nTwo decades ago, British Petroleum, a venerable and storied corporation, was running out of oil reserves. Along came a new CEO of vision and vast ambition, John Browne, who pulled off one of the greatest corporate turnarounds in history.\nBP bought one company after another and then relentlessly fired employees and cut costs. It skipped safety procedures, pumped toxic chemicals back into the ground, and let equipment languish, even while Browne claimed a new era of environmentally sustainable business as his own. For a while the strategy worked, making BP one of the most profitable corporations in the world. Then it all began to unravel, in felony convictions for environmental crimes and in one deadly accident after another. Employees and regulators warned that BP’s problems, unfixed, were spinning out of control, that another disaster―bigger and deadlier―was inevitable. Nobody was listening.\nHaving reported on business and the energy industry for nearly a decade, Abrahm Lustgarten uses interviews with key executives, former government investigators, and whistle-blowers along with his exclusive access to BP’s internal documents and emails to weave a spellbinding investigative narrative of hubris and greed well before the gulf oil spill.\nFailure: Why Science Is So Successful Stuart Firestein\nlink\nThe general public has a glorified view of the pursuit of scientific research. However, the idealized perception of science as a rule-based, methodical system for accumulating facts could not be further from the truth. Modern science involves the idiosyncratic, often bumbling search for understanding in uncharted territories, full of wrong turns, false findings, and the occasional remarkable success.\nIn his sequel to Ignorance (Oxford University Press, 2012), Stuart Firestein shows us that the scientific enterprise is riddled with mistakes and errors - and that this is a good thing! Failure: Why Science Is So Successful delves into the origins of scientific research as a process that relies upon trial and error, one which inevitably results in a hefty dose of failure. In fact, scientists throughout history have relied on failure to guide their research, viewing mistakes as a necessary part of the process. Citing both historical and contemporary examples, Firestein strips away the distorted view of science as infallible to provide the public with a rare, inside glimpse of the messy realities of the scientific process.\nAn insider\u0026rsquo;s view of how science is actually carried out, this book will delight anyone with an interest in science, from aspiring scientists to curious general readers. Accessible and entertaining, Failure illuminates the greatest and most productive adventure of human history, with all the missteps along the way.\nThe Theory of Materials Failure Richard M. Christensen\nlink\nA complete and comprehensive theory of failure is developed for homogeneous and isotropic materials. The full range of materials types are covered from very ductile metals to extremely brittle glasses and minerals. Two failure properties suffice to predict the general failure conditions under all states of stress. With this foundation to build upon, many other aspects of failure are also treated, such as extensions to anisotropic fiber composites, cumulative damage, creep and fatigue, and microscale and nanoscale approaches to failure.\nThe Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine Michael Lewis\nlink\nWhen the crash of the U. S. stock market became public knowledge in the fall of 2008, it was already old news. The real crash, the silent crash, had taken place over the previous year, in bizarre feeder markets where the sun doesn’t shine, and the SEC doesn’t dare, or bother, to tread: the bond and real estate derivative markets where geeks invent impenetrable securities to profit from the misery of lower- and middle-class Americans who can’t pay their debts. The smart people who understood what was or might be happening were paralyzed by hope and fear; in any case, they weren’t talking.\nThe crucial question is this: Who understood the risk inherent in the assumption of ever-rising real estate prices, a risk compounded daily by the creation of those arcane, artificial securities loosely based on piles of doubtful mortgages? Michael Lewis turns the inquiry on its head to create a fresh, character-driven narrative brimming with indignation and dark humor, a fitting sequel to his #1 best-selling Liar’s Poker. Who got it right? he asks. Who saw the real estate market for the black hole it would become, and eventually made billions of dollars from that perception? And what qualities of character made those few persist when their peers and colleagues dismissed them as Chicken Littles? Out of this handful of unlikely―really unlikely―heroes, Lewis fashions a story as compelling and unusual as any of his earlier bestsellers, proving yet again that he is the finest and funniest chronicler of our times.\n","permalink":"https://danaukes.com/notebook/failure/failure-books/","tags":["failure"],"title":"Books on Failure"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Ingredients 12 eggs 1/2 cup flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 2 cups cottage cheese (less than one large container) 2 cups grated Cheddar cheese 2 cups grated Monterey Jack cheese 1/4 cup melted butter 1/2 lb. pork sausage, fried and drained (could substitute diced ham) Directions mix eggs, flour and baking powder. add remaining ingredients. bake in greased 9 x 13\u0026quot; casserole dish (or pan) at 350 degrees for 1 hour.

While steaming prepare meat mixture. Watch and once it is steamed removed and drain water off and let sit with lid on to keep moist. This can be made ahead of time so the flavors will do their thing. I made it the day before and let it set all night in the refrigerator. Combine both meats, onion, rice, garlic \u0026amp; salt and pepper and mix well. Spape your meat mixture into rolls about as long as your index finger and 3/4\u0026quot; in diameter. Wrap your rolled meat mixture in one leaf of your steamed cabbage. Start by putting down a layer of saurkraut on the bottom of your stew kettle/dutch oven, then place a layer of cabbage rolls and continue to do this (2-3 layers is what I had) and you should end up at the top with a layer for saurkraut. Pour your broth (or water) over the top and season more if desired with salt \u0026amp; pepper. Once you are done place on your back burner, cover with lid, and bring to a boil. Once it\u0026rsquo;s boiling lower to simmer, continue with lid still on, and continue for 2-1/2 hours. It is okay to let it sit in the juice as it just give it more flavor. I have thought about adding a can of diced tomatoes but that is not part of this recipe. But it sounds like a great addition to me!

Add the onion and garlic. Add the beef and allow it to brown on the outside. Top with paprika and stir till meat is covered. Add Wondra flour and tomato paste just until the juice is soaked up then add water to cover meat with some extra. Make sure to mix the flour in well to remove all lumps. Add in salt and pepper.

Add a little bit more salt to your mashies. For my amount I used two eggs and a little bit of milk. Add some flour and start mixing it in. Keep adding more flour. As soon as it turns to sort-of-dough consistency, dump it on your counter and work it with your hands. (Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to keep adding flour.) Yup, now it finally looks like dough! I\u0026rsquo;m gonna make one big dumpling that I\u0026rsquo;m gonna freeze for later. The big ones are being cooked whole and then sliced to go with foods like Goulash :) Wrap it up in foil to freeze it, or you can cook it and eat it or freeze it. Because of the differences in flour, it\u0026rsquo;s better to cook it in the foil, so it keeps the right shape. Now make a \u0026ldquo;cylinder\u0026rdquo; with a part of your dough and cut it up like I did. I\u0026rsquo;m sure yours are gonna look way better than mine. I\u0026rsquo;m an awesome theoretical cook, but when it comes to aesthetics, it never comes out like I pictured it in my head :) Now throw them in salted boiling water! They\u0026rsquo;re good to go as soon as they start floating on the surface. Yup\u0026hellip; I wish they looked at least half good as my mom\u0026rsquo;s and grandma\u0026rsquo;s dumplings.

Gently stir to wash the figs, then drain off the water and rinse the figs thoroughly with fresh cool water. Place the figs into a large pot. Add 1 cup water, sugar, butter, vanilla extract, lemon, lemon juice, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves. Very gently stir the mixture to dissolve the sugar, keeping the figs intact as much as possible. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat; reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the figs are golden brown and coated in syrup, about 1 hour. Stir gently a couple of times to keep the figs from burning onto the bottom of the pot. Add a pinch of salt, if desired, to tame the sweetness. Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the figs into the hot, sterilized jars and top off with syrup, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2 inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 15 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area, and wait at least 2 days before opening. Place the whole figs in the pot, and let them break apart naturally, do not cut them in half. If you do not seal jars in boiling water, the mixture must be eaten in 30 days.

Don\u0026rsquo;t let the water and butter boil away while you grate the cheese. Second is to let the batter cool for a few minutes before adding the eggs so you don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026lsquo;cook\u0026rsquo; them. Make sure when you stir in the eggs that you do it vigorously. 1. Preheat the oven to 425F (220C.) Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 2. Heat the water, butter, salt, and chile in a saucepan until the butter is melted. 3. Dump in the flour all at once and stir vigorously until the mixture pulls away from the sides into a smooth ball. Remove from heat and let rest two minutes. 4. Add the eggs, one at a time, stirring quickly to make sure the eggs don\u0026rsquo;t \u0026lsquo;cook.\u0026rsquo; The batter will first appear lumpy, but it will smooth out. 5. Add about 3/4s of the grated cheese and the chives, and stir until well-mixed. 6. Scrape the mixture into a pastry bag pipe the dough into mounds, evenly-spaced apart, making each about the size of a small cherry tomato. 7. Top each puff with a bit of the remaining cheese, then pop the baking sheet in the oven. 8. Bake for 10 minutes, then turn the oven down to 375F (190C) and bake for an additional 20 to 25 minutes, until they\u0026rsquo;re completely golden brown. Serving: The puffs are best served warm, and if making them in advance, you can simply pipe the gougères on baking sheets and cook right before your guests arrive, or reheat the baked cheese puffs in a low oven for 5-10 minutes before serving. A bit of troubleshooting: The problem folks have with pâte à choux is them being deflated. The usual causes are too much liquid (eggs), or underbaking. Make sure to use large eggs, not extra-large or jumbo. And bake the puffs until they\u0026rsquo;re completely browned up the sides so they don\u0026rsquo;t sink when cooling.\n","permalink":"https://danaukes.com/recipes/french-cheese-puffs/","tags":null,"title":"French Cheese Puffs"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Ingredients Sesame Noodles 1 lb spaghettini (get the thinnest spaghetti you can find) 1⁄2 cup soy sauce 1⁄4 cup sesame oil (some reviewers have said that 1/2 cup of oil is too much and have halved the amount, so use your own) 1⁄3 cup sugar 3 scallions, thinly sliced 1⁄4 cup sesame seeds (or more)\nFunkey Chicken 1⁄4 cup soy sauce 1⁄4 cup teriyaki sauce 2 garlic cloves, minced 1⁄4 cup brown sugar 1 teaspoon fresh ginger, chopped (or 1/4 teaspoon dried) 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts sesame oil, for sauteing\nDirections First make the sesame noodles: Cook the spaghetti according to package directions.

Use a rolling pin to sheet the dough out to a 14–inch square, then cut the sheet into nine equal squares. Cut L-shaped slits on opposite corners of each square (creating a frame-like shape). Take hold of both corners and fold them toward the opposite corner, passing one point under the other and pressing them in place, to create a diamond-shaped pocket to hold the filling.

Slide crepe onto an ovenproof plate; cover with foil and transfer to oven. Repeat process with remaining batter, coating pan with more butter as needed. Fold each crepe into quarters to form a triangle. Arrange 3 crepes on each plate; drizzle with lemon-caramel sauce and garnish with candied lemon slices. Lemon-Caramel Sauce The sauce can be refrigerated in an airtight container up to three days. Gently reheat it just before serving.\nHeat sugar and 1/4 cup water in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until sugar has dissolved and syrup is clear. Continue to cook, without stirring, until syrup comes to a boil, occasionally washing down sides of pan with a wet pastry brush to prevent crystals from forming. Let syrup boil, gently swirling pan occasionally, until dark amber. Remove from heat; whisk in lemon juice, liqueur, butter, and 2 tablespoons water. (Caramel will steam and spatter) Serve warm Candied Lemon Slices The lemon slices can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature up to one day\nPrepare an ice-water bath; set aside. Using a mandolin or sharp knife, cut lemon into 12 paper-thin slices; discard seeds and ends of rind. Bring a medium saucepan of water to a rolling boil. Remove from heat, and add lemon slices; stir until softened, about 1 minute. Drain, and immediately plunge slices into ice-water bath. Drain. Bring sugar and 1 cup water to a boil in a medium skillet, swirling to dissolve sugar. When liquid is clear and bubbling, reduce heat to medium-low. Add lemon slices, arranging them in one layer with tongs. Simmer (do not let boil) until rinds are translucent, about 1 hour. Transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment. Let stand until ready to serve.

It does a great job of waking up the other things it’s served with – a few spoonfuls of this next to a grilled chicken breast or pork chop would be an absolute celebration. Veg-wise, the onion, coriander and white cabbage are non-negotiable, as they form the base of this salad, but feel free to have a play with the other ingredients and use things like fennel or asparagus. Basically whatever’s in season and available should be a nice addition. The easiest and quickest way to make this is to use a food processor with a slicer attachment or a mandolin. If you don’t have either of those, use a speed peeler, or simply grate everything finely. Shred your white and red cabbage into two separate piles. Put just the white cabbage into a large bowl with the radishes, carrots and most of the coriander. Mix everything together really well, then kick up the flavours by adding almost all the chopped chilli, the sliced red onion and a good few lugs of extra virgin olive oil. Add most of the lime juice and a good pinch of sea salt, then toss together and have a taste. Just keep adjusting everything, adding more fragrance with the coriander, heat with the last of the chilli and acid with another squeeze of lime juice, until it’s just right for you. When you’re happy, fold in the red cabbage right before serving so it doesn’t stain everything, and tuck in.

In large saucepan combine first 5 ingredients. Stir over low heat until blended.

Remove from heat, stir in semi-sweet chocolate pieces until they are melted. Stir in vanilla. Add nuts. Turn into greased pan and cool. Makes 2½ pounds.\n*The soft ball stage is a test to see if the fudge has been cooked to the proper stage. Before you start cooking, fill a small dish with ice water and set aside. After you have brought the recipe to a full boil for 3½ minutes, dribble a few drops of the mixture into the ice water from a wooden spoon. After it cools in the water (about 10 seconds), you should be able to roll it into small ball with your finger tips. If you put it in your mouth, it will be slightly chewy. If it passes these tests, you are done and should remove the mixture from heat and add the remaining ingredients. Otherwise, cook for another 30 seconds and try the test again. Most of the time, cooking time will not exceed 5 minutes.\nHint: As with all fudge recipes, cooking time will vary depending on factors such as humidity, altitude, and cooktop temperature.\n","permalink":"https://danaukes.com/recipes/never-fail-fudge/","tags":null,"title":"Never Fail Fudge"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Ingredients 2 cups (285 grams) bread flour 1 cup (142 grams) whole-wheat flour 2 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt, preferably Diamond Crystal (may substitute half as much table salt by volume) 1 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast (not rapid-rise) 1 1/2 cups (355 milliliters) cold milk (any percentage) 1/4 cup (100 grams) honey 1 large egg white, cold 1 cup (142 grams) fine cornmeal, for dusting 2 tablespoons (30 grams) unsalted butter, bacon fat or oil, plus more as needed Directions In a large bowl, whisk together the bread flour, whole wheat flour, kosher salt and yeast until well combined. Add the milk, honey and egg white, stirring with a flexible spatula until smooth, about 5 minutes. The dough will be fairly wet but elastic, and will start to come together into a ball. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a plate (or transfer to a lidded container) and set aside at room temperature (70 degrees) for 4 to 5 hours, until the dough is spongy, light and has more than doubled in size. (The timing is flexible depending on your schedule.)\nGenerously cover a large, rimmed baking sheet with an even layer of cornmeal (you may use about half to three-quarters of it). With a large spoon, dollop out a dozen 2 2/3-ounce (75 grams) portions of dough; it\u0026rsquo;s perfectly fine to do this by eye. If you\u0026rsquo;d like, pinch the irregular blobs with slightly dampened fingers to tidy their shape.

Griddle the muffins until their bottoms are golden brown, about 8 minutes, rotating each muffin 180 degrees halfway through so the outer edges are moved to the center for even browning. Flip with a square-end spatula and griddle until the other side is golden brown as well. Depending on the size of your skillet or griddle, you may have to cook the muffins in batches, adding 1/2 to 1 tablespoon of butter to the skillet each time. Transfer the muffins to a wire rack until cool enough to handle, then split the muffins by working your thumbs around the edges to pull them open a little at a time.

Place the cabbage on a clean dishtowel or cheesecloth and squeeze out any water. The dryer the cabbage the better. In a large bowl thoroughly mix the cabbage with all of the other ingredients, except the chicken stock. Cook a tester to check the seasoning.; Hot Water Dough In a stainless steel bowl mix flour and salt. Slowly add hot water to flour in 1/4 cup increments. Mix with chopsticks until a ball is formed and the dough is not too hot to handle. On a floured surface, knead dough until it becomes a smooth, elastic ball. Place back in bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rest for at least 1 hour. Working on a floured surface with floured hands, roll out dough to form a long \u0026rsquo;noodle\u0026rsquo;, 1-inch in diameter. Cut 1/2-inch pieces and turn them over so the cut sides are facing up. Flatten with your palm and roll out thin using a rolling pin. The dumpling wrapper should end up about 3 inches in diameter. MAKING THE DUMPLINGS: Place a small mound of filling in the middle of the wrapper. (Be very careful not to touch the edges with the filling as this will impede proper sealing of the dumplings. Nothing is worse than dumplings breaking during cooking.) Fold the wrapper in half to form a half moon shape. Starting on one end fold/pinch the wrapper tightly together. Proceed with this fold/pinch method until the dumpling is completely sealed. There will be approximately 10 to 14 folds per dumpling. Rest the dumplings with the folded edges straight up. COOKING THE DUMPLINGS In a hot saute pan coated well with oil, place pot stickers flat side down and cook until the bottom is browned. Have pan cover ready and add 1 cup of chicken stock, cover immediately. Be careful, the liquid will splatter! The stock will steam the pot stickers. Check them in 5 minutes as more stock may be needed. The trick here is that once the dumplings are firm and fully cooked the stock will evaporate and the bottoms will crisp-up again. SPICY SOY DIPPING SAUCE: Combine all and serve in a small bowl. Plating Serve pot stickers on a large platter lined with lettuce with a bowl of dipping sauce on the side.\n","permalink":"https://danaukes.com/recipes/pork-and-ginger-pot-stickers/","tags":null,"title":"Pork and Ginger Pot Stickers"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This recipe from a story on chili-style dishes from around the world is one of those things that people just can’t stop eating; friends have been known to have thirds and then smile with slight embarrassment and serve themselves some more. Part of its appeal is that it smells so good while it’s cooking \u0026ndash; the combination of garlic, pork, orange juice and dark beer is extremely potent. It’s good served over rice or in bowls with corn bread on the side.\nIngredients 1 cup orange juice 1 (12-ounce) bottle dark beer 1 pound tomatillos, papery husks removed, quartered 1/4 cup peanut oil 1 head garlic, peeled 2 pounds boneless pork, cut into 1/2-inch cubes Salt, pepper 2 large onions, thinly sliced 2 pounds Roma tomatoes, chopped 3 jalapeno chiles, diced 1 teaspoon crushed hot red pepper, or more to taste 1 bunch cilantro, leaves chopped 1 (1-pound) can black beans with liquid or 1 1/2 cups homemade cooked black beans with liquid Cooked rice 1* /2 avocado, peeled and sliced Cilantro sprigs Lime Sour Cream Directions Combine orange juice, beer and tomatillos in large saucepan. Cook over medium heat about 20 minutes. Set aside. Heat peanut oil in large skillet. Add garlic cloves and cook 2 minutes. Stir in 1/4 of cubed pork and season to taste with salt and pepper. Brown pork on all sides, remove pork with slotted spoon and add to tomatillos. Cook remaining pork in skillet. Remove pork and garlic and add to tomatillos. Add onions and lightly brown. Add to tomatillo and pork mixture. Mix in tomatoes, jalapeno chiles, crushed red pepper and cilantro. Cover and cook over low heat 2 hours. (Chili can also be cooked in 350-degree oven 2 hours.) Add beans. Cook, uncovered, 1/2 hour more. Adjust seasonings to taste. Serve over rice, garnished with sliced avocado, sprigs of cilantro and Lime Sour Cream. Makes 6 servings.

Use a mandoline slicer or the slicing attachment of a food processor to slice the potatoes uniformly thin. A pound of dried beans, rice, or coins can be substituted for the pie weights. For an alternate method for unmolding the galette, see page 31.\nDIRECTIONS Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Place potatoes in large bowl and fill with cold water. Using hands, swirl to remove excess starch, then drain in colander. Spread potatoes onto kitchen towels and thoroughly dry. Whisk 4 tablespoons butter, cornstarch, salt, pepper, and rosemary (if using) together in large bowl. Add dried potatoes and toss until thoroughly coated. Place remaining tablespoon butter in heavy bottomed 10-inch ovenproof nonstick skillet and swirl to coat. Place 1 potato slice in center of skillet then overlap slices in circle around center slice, -followed by outer circle of overlapping slices. Gently place remaining sliced potatoes on top of first layer, arranging so they form even thickness. Place skillet over medium-high heat and cook until sizzling and potatoes around edge of skillet start to turn translucent, about 5 minutes. Spray 12-inch square of foil with nonstick cooking spray. Place foil, sprayed side down, on top of potatoes. Place 9-inch cake pan on top of foil and fill with 2 cups pie weights. Firmly press down on cake pan to compress potatoes. Transfer skillet to oven and bake 20 minutes. Remove cake pan and foil from skillet. Continue to cook until potatoes are tender when paring knife is inserted in center, 20 to 25 minutes. Return skillet to medium heat on stovetop and cook, gently shaking pan (use potholder—handle will be hot), until galette releases from sides of pan, 2 to 3 minutes. Off heat, place cutting board over skillet. With hands protected by oven mitts or potholders, using 1 hand to hold cutting board in place and 1 hand on skillet handle, carefully invert skillet and cutting board together. Lift skillet off galette. Using serrated knife, gently cut into wedges and serve immediately.

Add the leeks and garlic and cook, stirring regularly, until soft and wilted, about 10 minutes. Adjust the heat as necessary so as not to brown. Add the potatoes, broth, bay leaves, thyme, salt and pepper to pot and bring to a boil. Cover and turn the heat down to low. Simmer for 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are very soft. Fish out the thyme sprig and bay leaves, then purée the soup with a hand-held immersion blender until smooth. (Alternatively, use a standard blender to purée the soup in batches; see note.) Add the heavy cream and bring to a simmer. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. If soup is too thin, simmer until thickened. If it\u0026rsquo;s too thick, add water or stock to thin it out. Garnish with fresh herbs if desired. Notes If using a standard blender to purée the soup: be sure not to fill the jar more than halfway; leave the hole in the lid open and cover loosely with a dishtowel to allow the heat to escape; and pour blended soup into a clean pot.\nFreezer-Friendly Instructions The soup can be frozen, without the cream, for up to 3 months. Defrost the soup in the refrigerator for 12 hours and then reheat it on the stovetop over medium heat until hot.

Using a pastry blender, cut in the shortening until the pieces are the size of small peas. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the water over part of the mixture, then gently toss with a fork. Push moistened portion to the side of the bowl. Repeat, using 1 tablespoon of water at a time, until all is moistened. Divide the dough in half. Form each half into a ball and flatten slightly. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Transfer one piece of dough to a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough from the center to the edges to form a 12-inch circle. Wrap the crust around the rolling pin. Unroll it onto a 9-inch pie plate. Ease the crust into the pie plate, being careful not to stretch it. Trim the bottom crust evenly with the rim of the pie plate, and return the pastry-lined pie plate to the refrigerator. In a large mixing bowl, stir together the sugar and cornstarch.

Place the top crust over the pie and trim the edges, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang. Fold the top crust under the bottom crust, pressing lightly to seal. Crimp the edges of the crust and cut vents in the top to allow steam to escape. To prevent over-browning, cover the edge of the pie with foil. Bake in the preheated oven on the baking tray for 25 minutes. Remove the foil. Bake for an additional 20 to 30 minutes, or until the filling is bubbling and the crust is golden. Cool on a wire rack.

Pour into six 4-ounce ramekins Place ramekins in a baking dish; fill dish with boiling water halfway up the sides of the dishes. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until centers are barely set. Cool completely. Refrigerate for several hours and up to a couple of days. When ready to serve, top each custard with about a teaspoon of sugar in a thin layer. Shake it around the top until it\u0026rsquo;s even. Using a handheld food torch, cook the surface until sugar melts and browns or even blackens a bit, about 15 seconds. Serve immediately.

When the quinoa is done cooking, take it off the heat and set it aside for later. In a large dutch oven over medium heat, saute the diced onion in 3-4 tbsp of vegetable broth until it\u0026rsquo;s soft and translucent. Add minced garlic, 2 tbsp tomato paste, 1 ½ tbsp Italian seasonings, ½ tsp salt, and ½ tsp black pepper to the pot. Stir to combine and let it cook for a few minutes to toast the spices. Next, add the fire-roasted diced tomatoes (with the juice), diced bell peppers, green lentils, 1 tbsp maple syrup, and 4 cups of vegetable broth to the pot. Stir to combine and increase the heat to bring it to a low simmer. Reduce the heat to medium, and then let the soup cook for 25 minutes. Lastly, add the frozen spinach and the cooked quinoa and let it cook for 5 more minutes or until the spinach is warmed through. Notes Cook the quinoa in a separate pot and only add it to the soup right before you serve it. If you cook the quinoa in the soup, it will absorb most of the broth and the texture will be more like a stew. Don\u0026rsquo;t drain the juice from the can of fire-roasted tomatoes, it adds a lot of smoky flavor to the broth. Add the spinach at the end so it only cooks for about 5 minutes. By doing this, the spinach will retain its bright green color and make a prettier presentation. Store the leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for 4-5 days or you can freeze it for a future meal.

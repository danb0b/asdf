* 1/2 lemon, juiced
* 1/4 cup dry white wine
* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley
* 1 tablespoon chopped green onion
* 1 lemon, cut into wedges

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
1. Place 2 tablespoons butter in a microwave-safe bowl; melt in microwave on high, about 30 seconds. Stir buttery round crackers into melted butter.
1. Place remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a 7x11-inch baking dish. Melt in the preheated oven, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove dish from oven.

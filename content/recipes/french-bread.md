## Ingredients

* 2 cups warm water
* 1 tablespoon yeast
* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 5 to 5 1/2 cups bread flour

## Directions

1. Dissolve yeast in warm water (110 degrees) and sugar in large bowl; allow yeast to proof or foam (about 10 minutes).
1. Add salt, oil, and 3 cups flour; beat for 2 minutes.
1. Stir in 2 cups flour to make a stiff dough.
1. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.
1. Place in oiled bowl, turn dough to coat all sides, cover and let rise until doubled.
1. Punch down and divide in half.
1. Shape dough into two long slender loaves.
1. Grease and sprinkle with cornmeal either a french bread pan or large cookie sheet.
1. Place loaves in pan and cut diagonal gashes on top of each loaf (I use scissors).
1. Cover and let rise until doubled.
1. Bake at 375 degrees for about 30 minutes.
1. Note: You can sprinkle or spray water on the loaves during baking if you want a really crunchy crust.

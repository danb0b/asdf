The idea of this section of my website is to document some of my daily work during my sabbatical year and hopefully onward.  

sometimes it's hard to organize my thoughts and plan out my work, so hopefully writing down my daily thoughts will help me organize my thoughts better.

Brainstorming some things I'd like to get done before the semester begins

* [ ] Dynamixel controller functionality
* [ ] ESP32 / ROS2 Functionality.
* [ ] I would like to go through the mujoco tutorials and create a small working example
  * [ ] add compliance
  * [ ] add model fitting
  * [ ] add design optimization
* [ ] 
* [ ] ...

Projects for the year

* [ ] Fun project on turning images into triangulations
* [ ]

to clone a repository:

```bash
git clone my_git_address
```

list local branches:

```bash
git branch
```

list remote branches:

```
git branch --remote
```

Checkout and track a remote branch:

```bash
git checkout â€“track origin/xyz
```

Sometimes you want to see what has changed.  ```git status``` can be used to see which files have changed since the last commit.  Otherwise, you can use ```git diff``` to more closely inspect file changes line by line

Push a quick commit:

```bash
git add *
git commit -m "commit message"
git push
```

or combined:

```bash
git add * && git commit -m "update" && git push
```

## Submodules

to pull submodules

```

```

```

cd into the proper subdirectory
ensure you are attached to a branch:

```

if not check one out

```
git checkout [branchname]
```

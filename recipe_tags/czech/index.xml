&lt;ul>
&lt;li>1 lb sausage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 lb lean ground beef&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 large diced onion&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3 small cans saurkraut&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 large head of cabbage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 c long grain rice, uncooked&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 c broth (any kind or water)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4 clove diced garlic (to taste)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>salt &amp;amp; pepper to taste&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 Tbsp allspice, ground (my own personal addition)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Core head of cabbage and put in a stock pot with water (core side down) and steam. While steaming prepare meat mixture. Watch and once it is steamed removed and drain water off and let sit with lid on to keep moist.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This can be made ahead of time so the flavors will do their thing. I made it the day before and let it set all night in the refrigerator. Combine both meats, onion, rice, garlic &amp;amp; salt and pepper and mix well. Spape your meat mixture into rolls about as long as your index finger and 3/4&amp;quot; in diameter. Wrap your rolled meat mixture in one leaf of your steamed cabbage.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Start by putting down a layer of saurkraut on the bottom of your stew kettle/dutch oven, then place a layer of cabbage rolls and continue to do this (2-3 layers is what I had) and you should end up at the top with a layer for saurkraut.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pour your broth (or water) over the top and season more if desired with salt &amp;amp; pepper. Once you are done place on your back burner, cover with lid, and bring to a boil. Once it&amp;rsquo;s boiling lower to simmer, continue with lid still on, and continue for 2-1/2 hours.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is okay to let it sit in the juice as it just give it more flavor. I have thought about adding a can of diced tomatoes but that is not part of this recipe. But it sounds like a great addition to me!&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>2 tablespoons olive oil&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 large yellow onions, chopped&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3 lbs stewed beef in ½ inch cubes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4 to 6 tablespoons Hungarian paprika (fresh is best)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 tablespoon tomato paste&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 cloves of garlic, minced&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3 tablespoons Wondra flour&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Water to cover&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Salt and pepper to taste&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Warm the oil in a large pot on medium heat. Add the onion and garlic. Add the beef and allow it to brown on the outside.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Top with paprika and stir till meat is covered. Add Wondra flour and tomato paste just until the juice is soaked up then add water to cover meat with some extra. Make sure to mix the flour in well to remove all lumps.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add in salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer on low for about two hours. The sauce will gradually thicken and meat will become tender and fall apart. Once the sauce is thick and meat is tender it is ready to serve.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="notes">NOTES&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Serve with noodles, dumplings (boiled bread), or Spätzle. To make gluten free use cornstarch instead of flour for the thickening agent. Can also be served with rice.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Czech Potato Dumplings</title><link>https://www.danaukes.com/recipes/czech-potato-dumplings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.danaukes.com/recipes/czech-potato-dumplings/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Mashed potatoes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Egg&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Salt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All purpose flour&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>I had some leftover mashed potatoes from last night&amp;rsquo;s dinner and there&amp;rsquo;s no better way to use them than making potato dumplings!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add a little bit more salt to your mashies. For my amount I used two eggs and a little bit of milk. Add some flour and start mixing it in.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep adding more flour. As soon as it turns to sort-of-dough consistency, dump it on your counter and work it with your hands. (Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to keep adding flour.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yup, now it finally looks like dough!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m gonna make one big dumpling that I&amp;rsquo;m gonna freeze for later. The big ones are being cooked whole and then sliced to go with foods like Goulash :)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wrap it up in foil to freeze it, or you can cook it and eat it or freeze it. Because of the differences in flour, it&amp;rsquo;s better to cook it in the foil, so it keeps the right shape.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now make a &amp;ldquo;cylinder&amp;rdquo; with a part of your dough and cut it up like I did.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m sure yours are gonna look way better than mine. I&amp;rsquo;m an awesome theoretical cook, but when it comes to aesthetics, it never comes out like I pictured it in my head :)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now throw them in salted boiling water! They&amp;rsquo;re good to go as soon as they start floating on the surface.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yup&amp;hellip; I wish they looked at least half good as my mom&amp;rsquo;s and grandma&amp;rsquo;s dumplings. But they sure tasted better though (grandma makes them too firm, these just dissolved in my mouth :))&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I was baking some chicken breast on butter with just salt, pepper and little mustard on the top. As a side I also cooked some spinach on butter with an egg. Approved by my man, said it was yummy :)&lt;/li>

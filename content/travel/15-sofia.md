title: Sofia, Bulgaria (draft)

## Friday, August 25, 2023

We took an early cab from our loft to the bus station the next morning on our way to Sofia, Bulgaria.  One little gotcha that we discovered at the bus station was that we had to buy platform tickets, which let us out into the bus platform here. This was new to us.

The bus ride to Sofia was relatively less eventful than our trip to SKOPJE, but an interesting difference at the border was that we all had to get out of the bus in order to individually leave Macedonia on foot. The bus came to meet us after we left customs. Once at the Bulgarian station, we had to take all of our baggage out and let a dog come by and sniffed our luggage

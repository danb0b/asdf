### Course Descriptions

***EGR 494/598/557: Foldable Robotics***. ASU Polytechnic Campus. This course introduces students to the fundamentals of designing origami-inspired robots in a project-based format. I developed this course in Spring 2016. Responsibilities in the course include development and delivery of course material, project mentoring, etc. (This course is numbered differently for undergraduate and graduate students)

***EGR 304: Embedded Systems I***. ASU Polytechnic Campus. This is a project-based course that teaches the fundamentals of designing and fabricating PCB-based embedded systems. The course is delivered in a project-based format where teams. Responsibilities in the course include development, preparation, and delivery of course material, project mentoring, etc.

***EGR 314: Embedded Systems II***. ASU Polytechnic Campus. This project-based class focuses on extending concepts taught in EGR 304 through more advanced project specifications and topics. Responsibilities in the course include development, preparation, and delivery of course material, project mentoring, etc.

***EGR 202: Use-Inspired Design Project II***. ASU Polytechnic Campus. This course introduces students to a user-centered design process as it relates to developing products with engineering skillsets. Responsibilities in the course include preparation and delivery of course material, project mentoring, etc. I overhauled the course material in Spring 2016 and 2017 to include new modules related to modeling and experimentation in a mini-project format focused on electric motors.

***Informal Robotics***, Harvard Graduate School of Design. This course taught the design of informal robotic systems including soft and origami-inspired robotics, from a design, aesthetic, and research perspective. Responsibilities included development, co-teaching, and mentoring of teams.

***Dynamics of Mechanical, Aerospace, and Biomechanical Systems***, Stanford University. Teaching Assistant with Prof. Paul Mitiguy. Responsibilities included weekly study sections, research presentation in class, and office hours.

We took an early cab from our loft to the bus station the next morning on our way to Sofia, Bulgaria.  One little gotcha that we discovered at the bus station was that we had to buy platform tickets, which let us out into the bus platform here. This was new to us.

The bus ride to Sofia was relatively less eventful than our trip to Skopje, but an interesting difference at the border was that we all had to get out of the bus in order to individually leave Macedonia on foot. The bus came to meet us after we left customs. Once at the Bulgarian station, we had to take all of our baggage out and let a dog come by and sniffed our luggage

The bus ride was relativly smooth and uneventful.  After we got to Sofia, we walked the 30-minute walk to our place.  I had advocated for the walk, and, though I always like to walk to get to the place, it was a little longer than I expected.  Nevertheless, we made it there and unloaded our stuff.  I went out to get groceries.

We walked out to a park to help the kids let off some steam.  The playground in the city garden was unimpressive, but it allowed me and sara to get some things done, like find an ATM, buy some wine for our friends, and pick up some dinner.

We learned that our friends would not be joining us on their original flight, as there had been some 

We did school in the morning and then walked through town.  We walked through Knyazheska Garden, where we found a remnant of Bulgaria's communist past, fenced in to stave off the graffitos.

We continued on to Brisova Gradina Park, found a bigger playground, had a picnic with some snacks, and took kids to read in the shade.  Knowing we needed more food than that, we had a late lunch at a bar behind the stadium (called Behind), where we split some sandwiches and potato chips and watched the track and field world championships on TV.  We walked back to the apartment and had a special sushi dinner nearby.  The kids were tired; we put them to bed after watching a little Harry Potter, and waited up for our friends to arrive.  Sara headed to the airport and I stayed with the kids.  Our friends arrived around 10:15.

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter plus more for baking dish&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 pound good-quality day-old white bread, torn into 1&amp;quot; pieces (about 10 cups)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 1/2 cups chopped yellow onions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 1/2 cups 1/4&amp;quot; slices celery&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 teaspoons kosher salt&lt;/li>

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Preheat oven to 250°F. Butter a 13x9x2&amp;quot; baking dish and set aside. Scatter bread in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake, stirring occasionally, until dried out, about 1 hour. Let cool; transfer to a very large bowl.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meanwhile, melt 3/4 cup butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat; add onions and celery. Stir often until just beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Add to bowl with bread; stir in herbs, salt, and pepper. Drizzle in 1 1/4 cups broth and toss gently. Let cool.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Whisk 1 1/4 cups broth and eggs in a small bowl. Add to bread mixture; fold gently until thoroughly combined. Transfer to prepared dish, cover with foil, and bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of dressing registers 160°F, about 40 minutes. DO AHEAD: Dressing can be made 1 day ahead. Uncover; let cool. Cover; chill.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bake dressing, uncovered, until set and top is browned and crisp, 40-45 minutes longer (if chilled, add 10-15 minutes).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>1 acorn squash&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 apples, cored and sliced&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 tablespoon butter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 tablespoons brown sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 tablespoon finely chopped walnuts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 teaspoon salt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>To easily peel the acorn squash without losing a lot of vegetable, gently drop the squash in a large pot of boiling water, and boil for 15 minutes. Pour off the boiling water and fill with cold water and let sit 5 minutes to cool. When cool enough to handle, use a knife to slice off the peel on the ridges and use a teaspoon to dig out the peel in the valleys. Slice the squash in half and remove the seeds and stem. Then slice the halves into sections and finally cut into 1 inch chunks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Place the squash chunks into a large microwave-safe bowl along with the apples. Dot with pieces of butter. Sprinkle the brown sugar, walnuts, salt and cinnamon over the top. Cover with plastic wrap, and poke a few holes in it for ventilation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cook in the microwave for 7 1/2 minutes on full power. Remove, uncover, and stir. Return to the microwave, and cook for another 7 1/2 minutes on full power, until tender. Serve hot.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>8 medium-size beets, tops removed and scrubbed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 cup balsamic vinegar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 cup good olive oil&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 teaspoons Dijon mustard, such as Grey Poupon&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4 ounces baby arugula&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/3 cup roasted, salted Marcona almonds, toasted&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4 ounces soft goat cheese, such as Montrachet, crumbled&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wrap the beets individually in aluminum foil and place them on a sheet pan. Roast them for 50 minutes to 1 hour, depending on their size, until a small sharp knife inserted in the middle indicates that they are tender. Unwrap each beet and set aside for 10 minutes, until cool enough to handle. Peel the beets with a small, sharp knife over a piece of parchment paper to prevent staining your cutting board.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Meanwhile, whisk together the vinegar, olive oil, mustard, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper and set aside. While the beets are still warm, cut each one in half and then each half into 4 to 6 wedges and place them in a large mixing bowl. As you&amp;rsquo;re cutting the beets, toss them with half of the vinaigrette (warm beets absorb more vinaigrette), 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Taste for seasonings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Place the arugula in a separate bowl and toss it with enough vinaigrette to moisten. Put the arugula on a serving platter and then arrange the beets, almonds, and goat cheese on top. Drizzle with additional vinaigrette, if desired, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and serve warm or at room temperature.&lt;/li>

&lt;h3 id="topping">Topping&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>2 medium onions, thinly sliced&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 tablespoons panko bread crumbs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 teaspoon kosher salt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nonstick cooking spray&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="beans-and-sauce">Beans and Sauce&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 pound fresh green beans, rinsed, trimmed and halved&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>12 ounces mushrooms, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch pieces&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 cloves garlic, minced&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 cup chicken broth&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 cup half-and-half&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Combine the onions, flour, panko and salt in a large mixing bowl and toss to combine. Coat a sheet pan with nonstick cooking spray and evenly spread the onions on the pan. Place the pan on the middle rack of the oven and bake until golden brown, approximately 30 minutes. Toss the onions 2 to 3 times during cooking. Once done, remove from the oven and set aside until ready to use. Turn the oven down to 400 degrees F.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>While the onions are cooking, prepare the beans. Bring a gallon of water and 2 tablespoons of salt to a boil in an 8-quart saucepan. Add the beans and blanch for 5 minutes. Drain in a colander and immediately plunge the beans into a large bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Drain and set aside.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Melt the butter in a 12-inch cast iron skillet set over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, 1 teaspoon salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms begin to give up some of their liquid, approximately 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and nutmeg and continue to cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle the flour over the mixture and stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute. Add the broth and simmer for 1 minute. Decrease the heat to medium-low and add the half-and-half. Cook until the mixture thickens, stirring occasionally, approximately 6 to 8 minutes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Remove from the heat and stir in 1/4 of the onions and all of the green beans. Top with the remaining onions. Place into the oven and bake until bubbly, approximately 15 minutes. Remove and serve immediately.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>1 lb sausage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 lb lean ground beef&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 large diced onion&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3 small cans saurkraut&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 large head of cabbage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 c long grain rice, uncooked&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 c broth (any kind or water)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4 clove diced garlic (to taste)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>salt &amp;amp; pepper to taste&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 Tbsp allspice, ground (my own personal addition)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Core head of cabbage and put in a stock pot with water (core side down) and steam. While steaming prepare meat mixture. Watch and once it is steamed removed and drain water off and let sit with lid on to keep moist.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This can be made ahead of time so the flavors will do their thing. I made it the day before and let it set all night in the refrigerator. Combine both meats, onion, rice, garlic &amp;amp; salt and pepper and mix well. Spape your meat mixture into rolls about as long as your index finger and 3/4&amp;quot; in diameter. Wrap your rolled meat mixture in one leaf of your steamed cabbage.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Start by putting down a layer of saurkraut on the bottom of your stew kettle/dutch oven, then place a layer of cabbage rolls and continue to do this (2-3 layers is what I had) and you should end up at the top with a layer for saurkraut.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pour your broth (or water) over the top and season more if desired with salt &amp;amp; pepper. Once you are done place on your back burner, cover with lid, and bring to a boil. Once it&amp;rsquo;s boiling lower to simmer, continue with lid still on, and continue for 2-1/2 hours.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is okay to let it sit in the juice as it just give it more flavor. I have thought about adding a can of diced tomatoes but that is not part of this recipe. But it sounds like a great addition to me!&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Mashed potatoes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Egg&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Salt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>All purpose flour&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>I had some leftover mashed potatoes from last night&amp;rsquo;s dinner and there&amp;rsquo;s no better way to use them than making potato dumplings!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add a little bit more salt to your mashies. For my amount I used two eggs and a little bit of milk. Add some flour and start mixing it in.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep adding more flour. As soon as it turns to sort-of-dough consistency, dump it on your counter and work it with your hands. (Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to keep adding flour.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yup, now it finally looks like dough!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m gonna make one big dumpling that I&amp;rsquo;m gonna freeze for later. The big ones are being cooked whole and then sliced to go with foods like Goulash :)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wrap it up in foil to freeze it, or you can cook it and eat it or freeze it. Because of the differences in flour, it&amp;rsquo;s better to cook it in the foil, so it keeps the right shape.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now make a &amp;ldquo;cylinder&amp;rdquo; with a part of your dough and cut it up like I did.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;m sure yours are gonna look way better than mine. I&amp;rsquo;m an awesome theoretical cook, but when it comes to aesthetics, it never comes out like I pictured it in my head :)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Now throw them in salted boiling water! They&amp;rsquo;re good to go as soon as they start floating on the surface.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Yup&amp;hellip; I wish they looked at least half good as my mom&amp;rsquo;s and grandma&amp;rsquo;s dumplings. But they sure tasted better though (grandma makes them too firm, these just dissolved in my mouth :))&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I was baking some chicken breast on butter with just salt, pepper and little mustard on the top. As a side I also cooked some spinach on butter with an egg. Approved by my man, said it was yummy :)&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>8 large potatoes, peeled, cut into large wedges (about 6-7 wedges per potato)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4 garlic cloves, minced (more garlic is a good thing, less garlic is a no-no for this recipe)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 cup olive oil&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 cup water&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 tablespoon dried oregano (to taste)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 large lemon, juiced&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sea salt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>fresh coarse ground black pepper&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Preheat oven to 420°F A reviewer has suggested spraying the baking pan with Pam - that sounds like a great idea!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Put all the ingredients into a baking pan large enough to hold them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Season generously with sea salt and black pepper.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make sure your hands are very clean and put them in the pan and give everything a toss to distribute.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The garlic will drop into the water/oil solution but its flavour will permeate the potatoes, and this way, it won&amp;rsquo;t burn.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bake for 40 minutes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When a nice golden-brown crust has formed on the potatoes, give them a stir to bring the white underside up, season lightly with a bit more sea salt and pepper and just a light sprinkling of oregano.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add 1/2 cup more water if pan appears to be getting dry, and pop back into oven to brown other side of potatoes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>This will take about another 40 minutes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do not be afraid of overcooking the potatoes- they will be delicious.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Note: I often melt a bouillon cube in the water; if you do, make sure to cut back some on the salt.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>6 chicken thighs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 1/2 teaspoon mixed herbs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 teaspoon smoked paprika&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 teaspoon onion powder&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 teaspoon garlic powder&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 tablespoon Olive oil&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 cup onion chopped any types of onion would work for this recipe.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 tablespoon butter&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3 cups low sodium chicken stock.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Salt and pepper to taste&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 cup green onions to garnish sub with chives, parsley or coriander&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>To a small mixing bowl, add smoked paprika, mixed herbs, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and black pepper and mix to combine. Rinse the rice until the water runs clear and set aside.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>mixed spices in a small glass bowl.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the chicken thighs to a bigger bowl and add the seasoning reserving about a teaspoon for later. Mix until the chicken is well coated.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>raw chicken coated with seasoning.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Heat up olive oil on medium high heat, carefully add the chicken, skin side down and sear for about 3 minutes on each side until golden brown. Remove the chicken and place on a plate and set aside. (You can blot the oil with kitchen towel if it looks too much at this point as the chicken releases its own oil too)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>chicken searing in a skillet.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sauté the chopped onions in the hot oil until soft and translucent, add the butter, and stir until melted. stir in the rinsed rice and toast for about a minute or two making sure it doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan. Pour the chicken stock over the rice, add the reserved seasoning, and stir to combine. Deglaze the bottom of the pan while stirring by scraping the bottom of the pan. This way the rice doesn’t burn when cooking.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Taste and adjust seasoning to taste at this point&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Arrange the chicken thighs over the rice then cover the pot with its lid and cook on low-medium heat for about 15 to 20 minutes depending on the type of rice you are using. When the rice is done, it would be tender, fluffy and the water would be absorbed too.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>2 cups chopped napa cabbage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 tablespoon salt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/2 pound ground pork (Don&amp;rsquo;t get lean pork, the fat is good for juicy and flavorful dumplings)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 tablespoons minced ginger&lt;/li>

&lt;li>1/3 cup rice wine vinegar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1/3 cup sliced scallions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 teaspoon sesame oil&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 tablespoon sambal&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="directions">Directions&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Sprinkle cabbage with the 1/2 tablespoon of salt and let stand for 30 minutes. Place the cabbage on a clean dishtowel or cheesecloth and squeeze out any water. The dryer the cabbage the better. In a large bowl thoroughly mix the cabbage with all of the other ingredients, except the chicken stock. Cook a tester to check the seasoning.;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="hot-water-dough-1">Hot Water Dough&lt;/h3>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>In a stainless steel bowl mix flour and salt. Slowly add hot water to flour in 1/4 cup increments. Mix with chopsticks until a ball is formed and the dough is not too hot to handle. On a floured surface, knead dough until it becomes a smooth, elastic ball. Place back in bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rest for at least 1 hour. Working on a floured surface with floured hands, roll out dough to form a long &amp;rsquo;noodle&amp;rsquo;, 1-inch in diameter. Cut 1/2-inch pieces and turn them over so the cut sides are facing up. Flatten with your palm and roll out thin using a rolling pin. The dumpling wrapper should end up about 3 inches in diameter.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="making-the-dumplings">MAKING THE DUMPLINGS:&lt;/h3>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Place a small mound of filling in the middle of the wrapper. (Be very careful not to touch the edges with the filling as this will impede proper sealing of the dumplings. Nothing is worse than dumplings breaking during cooking.) Fold the wrapper in half to form a half moon shape. Starting on one end fold/pinch the wrapper tightly together. Proceed with this fold/pinch method until the dumpling is completely sealed. There will be approximately 10 to 14 folds per dumpling. Rest the dumplings with the folded edges straight up.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="cooking-the-dumplings">COOKING THE DUMPLINGS&lt;/h3>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>In a hot saute pan coated well with oil, place pot stickers flat side down and cook until the bottom is browned. Have pan cover ready and add 1 cup of chicken stock, cover immediately. Be careful, the liquid will splatter! The stock will steam the pot stickers. Check them in 5 minutes as more stock may be needed. The trick here is that once the dumplings are firm and fully cooked the stock will evaporate and the bottoms will crisp-up again.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>In order for the potato cake to hold together, it is important to slice the potatoes no more than 1/8 inch (3 mm) thick and to make sure the slices are thoroughly dried before assembling the cake. Use a mandoline slicer or the slicing attachment of a food processor to slice the potatoes uniformly thin. A pound of dried beans, rice, or coins can be substituted for the pie weights.

### Friday, July 7

We arrived Friday morning in Frankfurt.  Sara didn't sleep much at all.  I got a bit of sleep. but we're talking maybe 1-2 hours?  The kids were zombies when they had to leave the plane.

Because our flight had been delayed, we had a relatively tight connection, which required us to deplane, enter customs, re-enter security, and switch terminals.  All went ok, though if anything hadn't gone well we would have been in more trouble.  There was some confusion as to which terminal / gate our plane was in.  I didn't get coffee before the flight :(

Ben slept on the second leg, which was a relatively short trip to Nice.

We arrived in Nice minus Sam's bag.  The AirBNB doesn't have a street number so we are hopeful that it will arrive here safely the next day.  They apparently found it.

We got our internet working and before we collapsed, went down to the port to meet up with Mark and Shayna.  They have been here over 2 weeks, and were able to orient us pretty quickly.  We got a quick drink / snack, found some gelato for the kids, got tickets for the bus, identified the famous free sparkling water station, and took a bus back to our AirBNB, where we collapsed pretty quickly at 6pm. 

It was a really windy day, but hot, and there was some debate in my mind whether we should use the A/C or leave the windows open.  The AirBNB Host said there could be mosquitos, but we kept them open anyways.  I may have gotten some bug bites and probably didn't sleep as well, but I did sleep 12 hours.

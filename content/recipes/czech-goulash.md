## Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 large yellow onions, chopped
* 3 lbs stewed beef in ½ inch cubes
* 4 to 6 tablespoons Hungarian paprika (fresh is best)
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste
* 2 cloves of garlic, minced
* 3 tablespoons Wondra flour
* Water to cover
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Directions

1. Warm the oil in a large pot on medium heat. Add the onion and garlic. Add the beef and allow it to brown on the outside.
1. Top with paprika and stir till meat is covered. Add Wondra flour and tomato paste just until the juice is soaked up then add water to cover meat with some extra. Make sure to mix the flour in well to remove all lumps.
1. Add in salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer on low for about two hours. The sauce will gradually thicken and meat will become tender and fall apart. Once the sauce is thick and meat is tender it is ready to serve.

## NOTES

Serve with noodles, dumplings (boiled bread), or Spätzle. To make gluten free use cornstarch instead of flour for the thickening agent. Can also be served with rice.

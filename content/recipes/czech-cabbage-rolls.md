## Ingredients
* 1 lb sausage
* 1 lb lean ground beef
* 1 large diced onion
* 3 small cans saurkraut
* 1 large head of cabbage
* 1/2 c long grain rice, uncooked
* 1/2 c broth (any kind or water)
* 4 clove diced garlic (to taste)
* salt & pepper to taste
* 1 Tbsp allspice, ground (my own personal addition)

## Directions
1. Core head of cabbage and put in a stock pot with water (core side down) and steam. While steaming prepare meat mixture. Watch and once it is steamed removed and drain water off and let sit with lid on to keep moist.
2. This can be made ahead of time so the flavors will do their thing. I made it the day before and let it set all night in the refrigerator. Combine both meats, onion, rice, garlic & salt and pepper and mix well. Spape your meat mixture into rolls about as long as your index finger and 3/4" in diameter. Wrap your rolled meat mixture in one leaf of your steamed cabbage.
3. Start by putting down a layer of saurkraut on the bottom of your stew kettle/dutch oven, then place a layer of cabbage rolls and continue to do this (2-3 layers is what I had) and you should end up at the top with a layer for saurkraut.
4. Pour your broth (or water) over the top and season more if desired with salt & pepper. Once you are done place on your back burner, cover with lid, and bring to a boil. Once it's boiling lower to simmer, continue with lid still on, and continue for 2-1/2 hours.
5. It is okay to let it sit in the juice as it just give it more flavor. I have thought about adding a can of diced tomatoes but that is not part of this recipe. But it sounds like a great addition to me!
